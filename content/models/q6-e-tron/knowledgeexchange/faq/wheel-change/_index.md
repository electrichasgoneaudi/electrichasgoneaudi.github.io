You would think changing wheels on your Audi Q6 is common knowledge. Well, it's not.

The problem is that the car's rear wheel brakes are engaged, even when wheel change mode is set. What happens then is that the rear wheels twist a few degrees when you jack up the car, creating significant pressure on the wheel bolts, making them very difficult to unscrew and even more difficult to screw back in.

Audi or the importer has not managed to come up with a solution for this.

But this is very easy to do, you just need to do a couple of small tricks, and here they are:

Note that this applies **only** to the rear wheels, not the front wheels.

Use this procedure and it will work fine.

NOTE!
- **The prerequisite is that the car is on completely level ground. It is very important that the car cannot roll away.**

- You do this at your own risk

NOTE!

## Here's the procedure

- Position your jack ready under the car. You should have a proper jack, like Bacho 3000 or similar.
- Put the car in N, and you will get a popup asking you to confirm that the car should roll freely when you exit the car.

- Answer yes to this question and confirm your choice
- Then you can jack up the car at the back, and when the rear wheel has left the ground, you can carefully enter the car and activate the parking brake. You will hear the car engage the brakes. Important that this is done with the wheel still on the car. This is because if the car should happen to roll a tiny bit, the wheel is still on the car.
- Now the parking brake is on and you will be able to unscrew the rear wheel in a safe and good way without any risk of damaging the wheel bolts.
- Repeat the procedure on the other rear wheel.
