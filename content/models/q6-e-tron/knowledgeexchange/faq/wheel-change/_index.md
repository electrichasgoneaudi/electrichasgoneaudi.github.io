You would think changing wheels on your Audi Q6 is common knowledge. Well, it's not.

The problem is that the car's rear wheel brakes are engaged, even when wheel change mode is set. What happens then is that the rear wheels twist a few degrees when you jack up the car, creating significant pressure on the wheel bolts, making them very difficult to unscrew and even more difficult to screw back in.

Audi or the importer has not managed to come up with a solution for this.

But this is very easy to do, you just need to do a couple of small tricks, and here they are:

Note that this applies **only** to the rear wheels, not the front wheels.

Use this procedure and it will work fine.

NOTE!
- **The prerequisite is that the car is on completely level ground. It is very important that the car cannot roll away.**

- You do this at your own risk

NOTE!

## Here is the procedure for option 1

- Place your jack ready under the car. You should have a proper jack, ala Bacho 3000 or similar
- Put the car in N, and you will get a popup asking you to confirm that the car should roll freely when you have got out of the car.

- Answer yes to this question and confirm your choice
- Then you can jack up the car from behind, and when the rear wheel has left the ground, you can carefully get into the car and activate the parking brake. You will hear the car apply the brakes. It is important that this is done with the wheel still on the car. This is because if the car should decide to roll a little, the wheel is still on the car.
- Now the parking brake is on and you will be able to remove the rear wheel in a safe and good way without any risk of damaging the wheel bolts at the back.
- Repeat the procedure on the other rear wheel.

## Here is the procedure for option 2

- Place your jack ready under the car. You should have a proper jack, like Bacho 3000 or similar
- Leave the car in 'gear'. That is, completely normal, but with the parking brake on. Then you can release the parking brake via MMI. Then there are no brakes on, but the car is in gear, so a tiny bit of movement is allowed, but the car will not move because it is actually in gear.
- Go into the MMI and select Car
- select Electromechanical parking brake

- Hold the brake pedal and click the button in the MMI

- You will see that the parking brake is off and that the car is in gear

- If you have air suspension, you should change the selection in the MMI menu to wheel change mode

- Then you can jack up the car at the rear and change the wheel as normal
