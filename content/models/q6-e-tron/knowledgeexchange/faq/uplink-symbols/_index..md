There are up to 3 different wireless connections from the car to the outside world.

You can see these at the bottom left of the main menu on the MMI, and an example is shown in the image below:

## Symbol in red ring

The symbol in the red ring shows the signal strength of your phone if you have connected it via Bluetooth. This is a mobile data connection.

## Symbol in green ring

![Test](image-2.png "asdf")

The symbol in the green ring shows the signal strength of your smartphone data connection. This is the connection used when you install apps from the App Store, and also the connection that the installed apps will use.

Note! This connection must be installed by the user in the car for it to be activated. It is described how to order and set up this connection in the document about [Internet in the car](../internet-in-the-car).

This is a WiFi connection.

There is also a traffic symbol at the top left of the green ring that shows when there is actually traffic on the connection.

## Symbol in blue ring

The symbol in the blue ring shows the car's uplink. This is the connection used for the car's licensed services.

This is a mobile data connection.

Examples of this are:

- Map updates
- Audi Connect/myAudi updates, i.e., data displayed in the myAudi app
- Audi store functions
- Emergency calls
- Roadside assistance calls
- All other data used by the car's built-in services

Licensed connections are mentioned, as you get 3 years of Audi Connect and 10 years of Audi emergency calls when the car is new.

Audi Connect must be renewed as a paid service when the car is older than 3 years.
