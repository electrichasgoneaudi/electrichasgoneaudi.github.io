First. What is the expected charging rate? Under optimal conditions, the charge curve will look like this.

That means that you often see 150kW up to 80% and 100kW to 85% and still above 50kW at 100%. This makes the Audi e-tron one of the fastest charging cars on the market.

But people may see that their charging speed is much slower than this.

### Reason 1. Cold battery

The most common reason for reduced charging speed is that the battery is cold. The ideal battery temperature is about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for maximum charging performance.

When the battery temperature is cold, the chemistry in the battery is not able to receive the same amount of energy, and the charging speed is reduced.

#### How to prevent it?

On the Audi e-tron, there is not much you can do while driving except drive longer before you charge or harder that increases the temperature. On other models like Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT the car heats the battery if navigation is set to a High Power Charger.

### Reason 2. Shared infrastructure

On some chargers there is a shared infrastructure and if many charges at the same time, the speed is reduced for each charger.

### Reason 3. Error on charger

In some cases, there are issues with the charger. If there is more than one available charger at the charging location there is always the possibility to try another.
