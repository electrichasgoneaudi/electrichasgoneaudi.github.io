## Upcoming versions

### Audi Q6 e-tron

This variant is the standard range version with RWD and 83kWh battery. I expected WLTP to be around 500km. This variant is confirmed, but the name is not official. 


### Audi RSQ6 

These are the super-performance versions. I expected around 600HP, like the Macan Turbo. This variant has not been confirmed, but prototypes has been seen testing.


## Sportback version

Sportback versions of the above models will also be released. The First Sportback versions are expected to have their world premiere in the summer of 2024.
