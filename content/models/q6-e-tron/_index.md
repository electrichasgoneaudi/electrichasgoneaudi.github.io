## Drivetrain

### Battery & Range

The battery in the Q6 e-tron consists of twelve or ten modules with prismatic cells. The nickel, cobalt, and manganese ratio is 8:1:1, and the battery achieves a higher energy density.

The battery with the launch to have the following specifications

- Twelve modules/180 cells with 100 kWh gross (96.8 kWh net)
- Twelve modules/192 cells with 107 kWh gross (96.8 kWh net) (China only)

These batteries will give the Audi Q6 e-tron a WLTP of 625km, depending on the trim level for the 100kWh battery (15.18 kWh/100km). Thanks to 800-volt technology, the Q6 e-tron can be charged with a capacity of more than 270kW.


{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/q6-e-tron/drivetrain/battery/charging_1_st.jpg" width="3000" height="2249" title="Audi Q6 e-tron with up to 270 KW charging" >}}

You can charge the battery from five to 80 percent in less than 25 minutes on an 800-volt 350KW charger.

If the station uses 400-volt technology, the Q6 e-tron uses 'bank charging' for the first time, whereby corresponding high-voltage switches (gates) are automatically switched in the battery before the actual charging process begins. This technology effectively splits the 800-volt battery into two batteries with a nominal voltage of 400 volts each that can charge in parallel on one 400-volt charging station without an additional HV booster. The states of charge of the two battery halves are first aligned. This functionality will only be available on the 100kWh and 107kWh battery.

### Motor and performance

The Audi Q6 e-tron comes in different performance versions.

- 2-wheel drive standard range (Audi Q6 e-tron 40?)
- 2-wheel drive long range (Audi Q6 e-tron 45?)
- Audi Q6 e-tron 55 quattro with 285KW/382hp (Europe version)
- Audi Q6 e-tron 55 quattro with 340KW/382hp (US version)
- Audi SQ6 e-tron  with 380KW/510hP + 20kw boost
- Audi RSQ6 e-tron with 450kW and +1000nm and rear axle steering

Audi will use different motor setups on the on the comming the variants.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/q6-e-tron/motors_st.jpg" width="1768" height="868" title="Motors for Audi Q6 e-tron" >}}

Audi uses permanently excited synchronous electric motors (PSM) with hairpin winding on the PPE platform for the rear motor and asynchronous motors on the front.
Permanent magnets are fitted on the AC motor's rotor, generating a permanent magnetic field. As a result, compared to asynchronous motors (ASM), PSMs offer higher power and torque densities, greater efficiency, and better reproducibility of the power output.

### Suspension and steering

The Audi Q6 e-tron has new shock absorbers. They come with steel springs as standard or optional air suspension.

The Audi Q6 e-tron introduces thrilling new feature-two-valve shock absorbers. These innovative absorbers offer a significantly greater damper characteristic spread, enhancing the vehicle's performance. But that's not all. They can also be adjusted independently, providing a noticeable boost in comfort. This unique versatility brings the driving programs of the future Q6 e-tron to life, each one offering a distinct and exhilarating experience.

The Audi Drive Select is combined with air suspension and steel suspension. The system reacts to the road condition, speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration, accelerator pedal modulation, steering behavior, and the car's position level.

With air suspension, depending on the speed, the body can be lowered in combination with the air suspension, improving the aerodynamics for an increased range.

The wheel widths on the front and rear axles differs significantly to accommodate the rear-focused weight distribution â€“ for more grip and driving dynamics. 

The Audi Drive Select is combined with the air suspension in the all-electric Q6 but may also be combined with the steel suspension. The system reacts to the condition of the road but also the speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration, accelerator pedal modulation, steering behavior, and the position level of the car.

The Q6 e-tron has a completely revised double wishbone axle with a detached strut level at the front. Its kinematics and elastokinematics enable improved responsiveness, steering precision, and straight-line driving.

## Technology

The Audi A6 e-tron showcases cutting-edge technology, emphasizing advanced lighting and digital features. It offers digital daytime running lights with LED technology and second-generation digital OLED rear lights, which include around 45 segments per panel for enhanced car-to-x communication and road safety. The rear lights can display warning symbols in critical situations, and the front lights feature twelve dimmable segments for a dynamic light signature.

Inside, the A6 e-tron features the MMI panoramic display with OLED technology, consisting of an 11.9-inch virtual cockpit, a 14.5-inch touch display, and a 10.9-inch front passenger display. Active Privacy Mode allows passengers to enjoy entertainment without distracting the driver. The optional second-generation augmented reality head-up display (AR HuD) projects relevant information onto the windshield.

The infotainment system runs on Android Automotive OS, supporting over-the-air updates and third-party apps via the Audi Application Store. Voice control is significantly expanded with the Audi assistant, which integrates ChatGPT for natural language interaction.

The Bang & Olufsen Premium Sound System with headrest loudspeakers provides an immersive audio experience.
