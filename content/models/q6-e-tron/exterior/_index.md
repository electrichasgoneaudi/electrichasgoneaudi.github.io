The Audi Q6 e-tron has perfect proportions and is a further evolution of Audi's e-tron design. In the car’s bodywork, soft shapes are in constant interplay with the creases and edges, lending dynamism to the shadows even when stationary. The upright front with the completely closed and inverted Singleframe follows the design language specific to electric Audi models. The vertical design of the front end makes a powerful and confident impression. A mask in selenite silver or high-gloss black frames the highly three-dimensional grille and the side air intakes. The high-positioned daytime running lights give the Q6 e-tron a very striking and confident appearance.

The greenhouse stretches low and taut over the powerful body. It is slightly tapared towards the rear, and the gently sloping D-pillars flow elegantly into the bodywork’s muscular shoulders. The continuation between the D-pillar and the roof makes the cabin appear more elongated and the vehicle more dynamic. A prominent line that extends from the rear lights to the rear doors emphasizes the upper section of the quattro blisters - the contours of the body on which the gently sloping D-pillars are supported. The blisters are a core element of Audi's design DNA. Audi calls this central design principle "making technology visible". Thanks to the taut and precisely drawn quattro blisters, the car embodies a certain dynamism even when stationary. The shape of the Audi Q6 e-tron is reminiscent of the Audi e-tron GT3.

Its powerful and sporty stance, when stationary, is further emphasized by the strongly tucked-in and sills and aprons accented in black. The almost perfect proportions with short overhangs and long wheelbase support this design philosophy. The sill is set off in black, emphasizing the location of the battery. This is where the heart of the fully electric vehicle with 800-volt technology beats - and the Audi e-tron design philosophy places emission-free driving at the center of the design. The dynamically tapered rear creates a mixture of sporty elegance and power. The clean and large rear architecture with the continuous light strip gives the Audi Q6 e-tron the clarity and aplomb typical of Audi.

The exterior of the Audi Q6 e-tron is differentiated between an attractive entry-level variant and the S line variant. At market launch, up to eight exterior colors including the standard color magnetic gray solid as well as Manhattan gray metallic, glacier white metallic, stone red or mythos black metallic are available. They emphasize the powerful and progressive design of the exterior. Two shades of blue are available: plasma blue and Ascari blue. Daytona gray is reserved exclusively for the S line variant and the S model. The black pro styling package can be ordered as an option for the Q6 e-tron with S line or the SQ6 e-tron2. It is characterized by black accents for even more elegance and sportiness. The package includes dark Audi rings at the front and rear, dark window trim, additional parts including the radiator grille in body color, black exterior mirror housings, black inserts in the inverted, closed Singleframe, and the front and rear bumpers.

The interplay of exterior colors and exterior packages with contrasting paintwork in mythos black as standard or in body color on request offers plenty of scope for individualization.

The Audi SQ6 e-tron2 shows off its electric power in a sporty and elegant way. Silver-colored add-on parts set accents at the front and rear - an exclusive feature for the S models, as do the exterior mirror housings in an aluminum look. The horizontal blade at the rear also has an aluminum look, as do the elements in the side skirts and the Singleframe. The SQ6 e-tron2 comes with black 18-inch brake calipers with a diamond S logo and 20-inch wheels in a five-twin-spoke design in matt palladium as standard.

Speaking of the wheel range, the Audi Q6 e-tron starts with 18-inch ten-spoke wheels as standard and the 19-inch "5-double-spoke dynamic" wheel in graphite gray in the S Line. Wheels up to 21 inches are available as an option. In addition to the standard wheels of the respective Q6 e-tron models, there is a total of seven other different designs - from sporty to elegant - to choose from; four of these come from Audi Sport. The SQ6 e-tron2 starts with 20-inch wheels.

Whether magnetic grey or Ascari blue metallic, the two edition one models present the Audi Q6 e-tron with visual highlights: S line design, radiator grille in body color, 21-inch wheels, brake calipers in red, dimmed Matrix LED headlights plus, LED rear light pro, exterior package black. With the edition one grey, customers receive a key trimmed to match the car’s color (magnetic grey or Ascari blue) and with the Audi rings on the back.
