It is expected that the available battery would be 94%. Same as MEB based cars.
This would mean 94kWh/78kWh available battery on the different versions

## Cells

Porsche has confirmed the setup of the PPE battery. The cell will be a 152ah cell with 15 cells in each module.

With 12 modules that would mean that the 12 modules version would have a setup like

- 180s1p and 662 Volt nominal for the 12 module version
- 150s1p and 551 volt nominal for the 10 module version
