description: The lithium-ion battery system of the Audi Q6 e-tron can store up 100 kWh of energy and uses 800 volt system.
weight: 7

It is expected that Q6 will come with two different battery sizes.

- 100kWh gross/94.kWh net with 12 modules
- 83.3kWh/78kWh net gross with 10 modules

## Charging curve

Below is the charging curve for 100 kWh battery.

## Cells

The cell are 152ah cell with 15 cells in each module.

With 12 modules that would mean that the 12 modules version would have a setup like

- 180s1p and 662 Volt nominal for the 12 module version
- 150s1p and 551 volt nominal for the 10 module version


## Bank charging


The system is 800 volt but when charging on 400 volt chargers it uses bank charging and split pack in two
