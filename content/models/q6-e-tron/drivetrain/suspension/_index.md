Most of the systems and components belonging to the chassis of the Q6 e-tron model series are new developments. Experts tune them in line with the familiar Audi DNA in order to create a high level of emotionality and the premium experience typical of Audi.

The partially redesigned front axle has a significant influence on the driving dynamics of the Audi Q6 e-tron. For the first time in an Audi model, the control arms are arranged in front of the suspension arms in the direction of travel. This results, above all, in package advantages in favor of the arrangement of the high-voltage battery

The newly developed components lead to improved kinematic properties. The steering is now bolted to a subframe. The refined axle kinematics provide noticeably more driving dynamics. The new front axle also improves the steering behavior. This makes the vehicle appear significantly more agile. The stiffened torsion bar in the steering also contributes to increased steering precision. New software modules in the steering, as well as modified caster sections, further optimize the steering feedback and, thus, the steering feel.

With the combination of the new passive damping system FSD (Frequency Selective Damping) and the more agile front axle, the Audi Q6 e-tron is even more capable on road. The FSD reduces damping forces, particularly at high frequencies, for example, on cobblestones, and maintains high damping forces at low frequencies, such as those that occur when changing lanes or cornering. The adaptive air suspension - the air suspension with controlled damping - gives the vehicle a wide spread between smooth ride comfort and sporty handling. Depending on the speed and the driver's wishes, it adapts individually to the road conditions and regulates the ride height at different levels. The air suspension also offers level control for different load conditions.

The central chassis control unit, the Electronic Chassis Platform (ECP), regulates the operation of the dampers individually for each wheel every millisecond - depending on the road surface, the driving style, and the mode selected in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. Electromagnetic damper valves vary the flow of the hydraulic fluid. The optional electronically controlled, adaptive air suspension with continuously adjustable damping system on all four wheels automatically regulates the vehicle level and damping. This gives the electric SUV high ride comfort on the one hand but also offers enhanced driving dynamics on the other. Various modes, including level control and manual lifting function on all four wheels and lowering function on the rear axle, are set via Audi drive select. Depending on the mode selected, the vehicle is lowered by up to 30 millimeters (1.2 in) depending on the speed. Lowering the rear axle (minus 50 millimeters (2 in), activated by a button in the luggage compartment) makes it easier to access the luggage compartment and hitch up a trailer.

The normal level of the adaptive air suspension is 28 millimeters (1.1 in) lower than the level of the standard comfort suspension.

The rear-biased , highly variable all-wheel drive sysgem also enhances the dynamic driving characteristics of the Audi Q6 e-tron. The different dimensions of the electric motors on the rear and front axles enable rear-biased torque distribution even under full load. The rear tires of the Audi Q6 e-tron are wider than the front tires to accommodate the rear-biased weight distribution - for even more grip and better driving dynamics.
