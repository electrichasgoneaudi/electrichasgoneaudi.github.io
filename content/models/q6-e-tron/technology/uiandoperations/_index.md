Above the so-called Softwrap, the interior is dominated by the “digital stage” with the Audi MMI panoramic display and the MMI front passenger display. The clearly grouped displays are perfectly integrated into the design concept and give the interior a spacious and airy feel. The slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display features a curved design and OLED technology and consists of the MMI panoramic display with 11.9" Audi virtual cockpit and 14,5" MMI touch display. The area within the driver’s reach is designed as an arc, and the display, with its curved shape, mirrors this. What’s more, the form of the curved display is reminiscent of the Singleframe that defines Audi’s look. Special ambient lighting makes the curved display appear to float at night.

For the front passenger, the digital stage is systematically and individually complemented by the 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display, which is also perfectly integrated into the dashboard design. An active privacy mode with shutter technology lets the passenger watch movies undisturbed without distracting the driver. At the same time, it enables the passenger to assist the driver, for example, with navigation. In the basic version, the passenger infotainment display has a black high-gloss surface.

The optional augmented reality (AR) head-up display (HUD) for the Q6 e‑tron represents a significant advance in display technology at Audi. It reflects a large, tilted image plane across the windshield to the driver, showing relevant information such as speed, traffic signs, and assistance and navigation icons. The image plane is tilted forward for an enhanced AR experience. The focus of the human eye moves along with it. This process and the high virtual image distance create the impression that the items depicted are floating up to 200 meters (656 ft) away and that they interact directly with the environment. The driver can quickly understand the displays without being confused or distracted by them. They offer significant support, particularly in conditions with poor visibility. The field of view for AR content corresponds to a diagonal of about 88 inches from the driver’s perspective.
