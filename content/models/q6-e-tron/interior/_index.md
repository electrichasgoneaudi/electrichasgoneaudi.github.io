The properties of materials used were incorporated into the interior design at a very early stage of the development process and, in combination with the Audi MMI panoramic display and the MMI passenger display, create a visually clear digital stage.

The high-contrast design of the interior deliberately places elements in the foreground or background, creating a three-dimensional spatial architecture that is tailored to the occupants in terms of design and ergonomics. The ambiance in the interior was designed to be decidedly homely. The “Softwrap” extends from the doors across the entire cockpit to the center console, creating a homogeneous and enveloping feeling of space. The same colors and high-quality materials, some of which are made from recycled materials, can also be found in the seats. For example, the S line variant's Softwrap uses the recycled fabric Elastic Melange, which is made from 100 percent recycled polyester. The headlining, lining of the pillars, and the sun visors are made from Draft fabric, which is also 100 percent recycled polyester.

Audi offers the Argument fabric for the normal and sports seats. The sports seats with contrasting stitching (KN) are also optionally available in Elastic Melange fabric. In the S line and S model, the sports seat plus is optionally available in Dinamica microfiber, also a recycled material, or in fine Nappa leather with diamond quilting. Dinamica also adorns the door mirror. Although this fabric looks and feels like suede, almost half of it is made from recycled polyester, which comes from textile waste.

The application surfaces on the instrument panel are painted in volcano gray fine lacquer as standard. Alternatively, sweetgum natural in light brown, or birch linear natural in stone grey wood or matt brushed aluminum in anthracite can be ordered. Birch linear is a technically jointed veneer, i.e., a laminated wood that is cut into veneers and made from locally grown and FSC/PEFC-certified birch wood. This resource-saving process also produces less waste.

In the S line version and the S model, customers can choose a technical fabric in anthracite in addition to matt brushed aluminum in anthracite and open-pored carbon micro twill. The latter is an innovative, technical-looking polyester fabric with recycled content that is characterized by a tactile structure and a new look.

The materials used were selected from a functional point of view and at the same time ensure a clear design differentiation of the various vehicle areas in the interior. Comfort-oriented areas are designed with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control surfaces in high-quality, high-gloss black emphasize the clarity of interaction.

Specific features in the interior are reserved for the SQ6 e-tron, for example, the red ring around the start/stop button, the diamond with the S lettering in the seat, or S-specific displays in the MMI as well as black-painted brake calipers with S lettering on the exterior, the exterior mirror housing in Unique Chrome Silver, bumpers with aluminum inserts, the S sports suspension, and the e-tron sports sound with S tuning.

Thanks to the new Premium Platform Electric, which was developed specifically for e-mobility, the vehicle also has a generous feeling of space and roominess as well as a high level of everyday usability. The package of this SUV, in particular, has been specially designed to meet the needs of SUV customers. The interior offers plenty of storage space and stowage compartments. In the center console, there are two cup holders, a wireless cell phone charger, and a storage compartment below the center armrest with more than five liters (0.17 cu ft) of storage space. The greater comfort in the second row of seats is typical of an electric car without a center tunnel. The trunk offers 526 liters (18.6 cu ft) of storage space. If the rear seat bench is folded down, the storage space increases to up to 1,529 liters (54 cu ft). The rear seats can be folded down separately (40:20:40). A further 64 liters (2.3 cu ft) can be stored in the frunk (front trunk) under the hood - a convenient place to stow smaller travel bags, for example.
