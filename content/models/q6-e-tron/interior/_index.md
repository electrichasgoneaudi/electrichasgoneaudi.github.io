The interior features clear structures and emphasizes a cozy ambiance. The so-called Softwrap extends from the doors through the entire cockpit to the center console, creating a homogeneous and welcoming feeling of space. The colors and high-quality materials, some of which are made from recycled materials, are also used in the seats.

This brings together all the interior components as though they were designed as a single space; the occupants feel like they are in a snug cocoon. The materials used were selected with functionality in mind and delineate the different areas of the vehicle interior through their design. Areas emphasizing comfort stand out with their large surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed operating areas purposefully come in high-quality, high-gloss black to provide the necessary clarity when interacting with the vehicle.

The aim was to give the materials a much stronger presence by increasing their density and quality. The interior trim now becomes a functional design element. Besides providing a feeling of spaciousness, this philosophy creates clarity as well as comfort and coziness. Low-lying and slim horizontal air vents harmoniously add to the overall appearance. A set of controls in a “black panel” look is integrated into the door handle on the driver’s side and coordinates perfectly with the modern interior. It contains the most important functions, such as mirror settings, seat and door functions, and light and visibility settings.
