The **Audi A3 e-tron** is the **commonly used working name** for an upcoming compact all-electric Audi model that has been **spotted repeatedly in prototype testing**. While the final production name has **not yet been confirmed**, the A3 e-tron designation is widely used by media and enthusiasts due to its size, positioning, and historic name association.

This future model is expected to play a **key role in Audi’s entry-level EV lineup**, sitting below the A4/A6-sized electric models and targeting the premium compact segment in Europe and other global markets.

At this stage, Audi has **not officially revealed the car**, so much of what we know is based on prototype sightings, platform strategy, and Audi’s publicly stated roadmap.

## Naming: Audi A3 e-tron or something else?

The name **Audi A3 e-tron** is **not confirmed**.

What we know:
- Audi has historically used **“e-tron”** branding for electric models  
- The vehicle’s **size and proportions** closely match today’s Audi A3  
- Test vehicles have been described internally and externally as **A3-sized EVs**

What we don’t know:
- Whether Audi will **reuse the A3 name** for a fully electric model  
- If Audi will adopt a **new EV-specific name**, similar to the China-only E5  
- Whether “e-tron” will remain part of the model name long term  

Audi has already started **simplifying its naming strategy**, so a final name could differ significantly from current assumptions.

---

## Positioning and segment

Based on current information, the upcoming A3-sized EV is expected to be:

- Audi’s **smallest fully electric model** at launch  
- Positioned below the A4/A6 e-tron family  
- A **direct successor in spirit** to the A3, but electric-only  
- Competing with premium compact EVs such as electric hatchbacks and crossovers  

It is likely to be offered primarily as a **Sportback-style hatchback**, aligning with Audi’s strengths in compact premium design.

---

## Platform: likely MEB+ based

One of the strongest indicators from prototypes and supplier information is that the upcoming compact Audi EV will be based on the **MEB+ platform** from the Volkswagen Group.

What this suggests:
- **800-volt–capable electronics** (depending on final spec)  
- Improved efficiency compared to first-generation MEB cars  
- More compact battery packaging  
- Faster charging and better thermal management  

MEB+ is intended as an **evolution**, not a revolution, meaning Audi can bring a compact EV to market faster while focusing investment on future SSP-based models later in the decade.

---

## Design: clear A2 inspiration

One of the most interesting aspects of the prototypes is their **design direction**, which appears to reference the original Audi A2.

Observed and expected design elements:
- Short overhangs and **upright proportions**  
- A more **functional, efficient shape** rather than aggressive sportiness  
- Smooth surfaces and reduced visual complexity  
- Emphasis on **aerodynamics and interior space efficiency**  

This would mark a **deliberate shift** away from oversized wheels and aggressive lines, aligning with EV efficiency goals and urban usability.

If confirmed, this A2-inspired approach would be a **unique design statement** in Audi’s modern lineup.

---

## Body styles

What we expect:
- A **five-door Sportback / hatchback** as the core body style  

What remains unclear:
- Whether Audi will offer a **Sedan or Avant variant**  
- If a **crossover-style version** could follow later  

Given market trends and production efficiency, Audi is likely to start with **one highly optimized body style**.

---

## Interior and technology

Audi has not shown the interior, but expectations are informed by recent launches.

Likely interior characteristics:
- Fully digital cockpit with **next-generation MMI**  
- Fewer physical buttons, more touch and voice control  
- New software architecture shared with upcoming Audi EVs  
- Over-the-air updates as standard  

What we don’t yet know:
- Screen sizes and layout  
- Whether Audi will use **Android Automotive OS**  
- Level of interior material quality compared to larger models  

Given Audi’s premium positioning, the interior is expected to be **clearly above mainstream MEB-based models**, even if more restrained than A6 e-tron.

---

## Drivetrain and performance

At this point, **no confirmed technical specifications** exist.

What is likely:
- Single-motor **front-wheel drive** as the base version  
- Possible **dual-motor quattro** variant later  
- Battery sizes optimized for compact packaging rather than maximum range  

Expected priorities:
- High efficiency  
- Real-world urban and motorway usability  
- Competitive charging speeds for the segment  

This model is **unlikely to chase extreme power figures**, focusing instead on balance, efficiency, and accessibility.

---

## Production and timing

What we know:
- Prototypes are already undergoing **real-world testing**  
- Audi has confirmed work on a **new compact EV generation**  

What we don’t know:
- Final production location  
- Official reveal date  
- Market launch timing  

Based on current development pace, a **world premiere around 2026** with market launch shortly after is a realistic expectation.

---

## What we know vs what we don’t know

### What we know
- Compact Audi EV is in **advanced prototype testing**
- Likely based on **MEB+**
- A3-sized footprint
- Design appears **A2-inspired**
- Intended as Audi’s **entry-level EV**

### What we don’t know
- Final **model name**
- Exact battery sizes and range
- Interior layout and software details
- Full drivetrain lineup
- Pricing and market availability

## Why the upcoming A3-sized EV matters

This model is critical for Audi because it:
- Lowers the **entry point to Audi EV ownership**
- Brings electric mobility to a **high-volume segment**
- Signals a shift toward **efficiency-driven design**
- Bridges the gap until next-generation SSP models arrive  

If Audi executes this car well, it could become one of the **most important electric Audis of the decade**, even without headline-grabbing specs.

As soon as Audi releases official information or the first camo-free prototype appears, this article can be expanded with confirmed specifications, interior details, and final naming.
If you want, I can also:
- Prepare a **speculation vs confirmation tracker**
- Write a **future comparison** with ID.3 / Cupra Born
- Create a **timeline article** from A2 → A3 e-tron → SSP compact EVs
