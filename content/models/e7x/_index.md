The **AUDI E7X** is a **China-exclusive, fully electric premium SUV** and the **second production model** from **AUDI**, the China-only sister brand created through the cooperation between AUDI and SAIC. Following the AUDI E5 Sportback, the E7X further expands Audi’s localized electric portfolio tailored specifically to Chinese customers.

## Positioning and concept

The AUDI E7X is positioned as a **large, fully electric premium SUV**, designed without compromise between everyday usability, performance, and emotional appeal. According to Audi, it is aimed squarely at **tech-savvy Chinese customers**, combining Audi’s driving dynamics and build quality with deep integration into China’s digital ecosystem.

Unlike global Audi models, AUDI-branded vehicles **do not wear the four-ring logo**, instead featuring the brand name written in capital letters, underlining their distinct identity within the Chinese market.

## Design and dimensions

Key design characteristics include:

- Clean, monolithic surfaces with a calm yet striking appearance  
- Upright front end with a black wraparound loop  
- Vertically arranged **digital Matrix LED headlights**  
- Short overhangs and powerfully sculpted wheel arches  

The proportions underline its premium SUV status:

- Length: **5,049 mm**  
- Width: **2,002 mm**  
- Height: **1,708 mm**  
- Wheelbase: **3,060 mm**

## Platform and drivetrain

The AUDI E7X is built on the **Advanced Digitized Platform**, jointly developed with SAIC. This platform underpins a new generation of **intelligent, connected electric vehicles** for the Chinese market and enables significantly reduced development times through close collaboration between Audi’s teams in Germany and China.

Two powertrain variants will be available:

- **300 kW** system output  
- **500 kW** system output  

Both configurations are designed to deliver **strong performance and Audi-typical driving dynamics**, positioning the E7X firmly in the upper premium EV segment.

## Role within Audi’s China strategy

With the E7X, AUDI continues its strategy of offering **region-specific electric models** that complement the global Audi lineup in China rather than replacing it. The E7X combines:

- Audi DNA in terms of dynamics and quality  
- Seamless integration into China’s digital and connectivity ecosystem  
- A bold, progressive SUV design  

Together with the AUDI E5 Sportback, the E7X highlights Audi’s commitment to **localized innovation** in its most important electric vehicle market.

More details on the interior, software, and driving assistance systems are expected closer to the official debut at Auto China 2026.
