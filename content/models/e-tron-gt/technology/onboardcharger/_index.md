The onboard charger is responsible for converting AC from the wall to DC used in the battery.

The standard onboard charger support up to 11KW AC charging.

Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT have charge ports on both sides of the cars.

In the US the charging ports have a [J1772 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_J1772) to connect to the car, while in Europe it has a [Type 2 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector).

The driver side port only supports AC charging, while the passenger side port support both AC and DC charging.

To charge the car from AC you need a Wallbox to connect to or the [charging system that can connect to the domestic outlet](../chargingsystem).

### Optional 22KW charger

You can order an additional charging unit for the car (AX5). This gives the car 22KW charging capability on a 400Volt 32A 3 phases connection.

Option Id **KB4**

### Electric drive unit

In the illustration below you see the location of the charge units.

 Only AC charging goes through the charger. For DC charging, the CCS port is directly connected to the battery.
