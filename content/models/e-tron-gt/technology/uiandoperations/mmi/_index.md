Eleven antennas, all of which are integrated where they cannot be seen, connect the e-tron GT with the outside world. They receive and transmit audio, LTE, Bluetooth, and GPS signals; the fully electric gran turismo is connected in many different ways.

### Fast data transfer: MMI navigation plus

The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT come as standard with the MMI navigation plus information center, which supports the high-speed data transmission standard LTE Advanced and includes a Wi-Fi hotspot for the passengers’ mobile devices. The navigation system makes destination suggestions based on previous routes and provides lane-specific information on the traffic flow. The route is calculated both in the car and online on the servers of service provider HERE. It uses real-time data on the overall traffic situation, which enables predictive planning.

The Audi connect online services are split into two packages. The Audi connect navigation & infotainment package includes services such as traffic information online, navigation with Google Earth™, online radio, hybrid radio, and the Amazon Alexa voice assistant, which allows access to several thousands of Alexa skills. Car-to-X services can warn the driver about hazards such as road ice and help them to find free parking spots on the roadside or allow them to surf the green wave by communicating with traffic lights.
