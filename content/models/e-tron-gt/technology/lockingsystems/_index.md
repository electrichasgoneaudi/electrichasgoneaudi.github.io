## Advance key option 4I3

The standard advance/convenience key offers convenient control of access and engine start authorization without the key having to be actively operated

By operating the door handle, the vehicle can be opened without actively using the key. This is possible with all doors. The access authorization is confirmed by wireless communication between the key and the vehicle. 

To lock the vehicle from the outside, all you have to do is touch one of the sensor buttons on all door handles. 

As the standard key, the advance key on Audi e-tron is equipped with Keyless Go. This means
the engine start authorization is also released without actively actuating the convenience key.

To do this, the driver must sit in the vehicle and carry the convenience key with him.
