 The RS model is also fitted with six-piston calipers, which are available in red or orange as an option, and 410 millimeter (16.1 in) cast-iron disks with a tungsten carbide coating (optional in the e-tron GT quattro ). This Audi carbide brake system increases the braking performance and reduces wear and therefore brake dust. At the same time it prevents flash rust, a typical phenomenon seen in many electric cars that do not use their wheel brakes very often.

The top-of-the-line offering for both models includes brake disks made of carbon fiber ceramic, which are especially lightweight, powerful, and durable. They have a diameter of 420 millimeters (16.5 in) on the front axle, and their ten-piston calipers are painted in gray as standard, or in red or blue as an option.
