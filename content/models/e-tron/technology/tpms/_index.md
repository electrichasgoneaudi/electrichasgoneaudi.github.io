Audi e-tron is equipped with an indirect TPMS system as standard.  This means it uses the ABS sensor to detect if there are wheels with low pressure compared to the others.

### Direct TPMS

With direct TPMS there is an air pressure sensor in each tire that communicates with the car. This measures the temperature  and pressure for each wheel and presents this in the MMI.

Below you see how MMI indicates that the left front tire has much lower pressure than other wheels.
