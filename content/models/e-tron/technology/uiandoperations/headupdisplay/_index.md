The head-up display projects information relevant to the driver as symbols and numbers that can be quickly perceived within the driver’s direct field of view, including navigation and warning messages and data from assistance systems. The human eye perceives the information extremely quickly – and there’s no need for drivers to refocus from their accustomed long-range view.

The image is projected onto the windshield. The information appears to hover around two meters (6.6 ft) in front of the driver within a visual window measuring 200 x 80 mm (7.9 x 3.1 in). A TFT monitor with white LED backlighting generates the color image. Two aspherical mirrors magnify and redirect the image. The mirrors also compensate for any distortions due to the curvature of the windshield. The driver can use the Audi MMI to specify which information should be shown in the head-up display; the height and brightness can also be adjusted here.
