 It shows the calculated driving track based on the steering angle as well as auxiliary lines and guide lines. For parallel parking, the latter lines precisely direct steering into the parking space in conjunction with steering reversal points. The blue pictured surface in the camera image indicates where the vehicle will be positioned after the parking procedure. The reversing camera is inconspicuously integrated into the handle trim strip of the luggage compartment lid. It is activated as soon as the driver engages reverse gear or pushes the respective button.

Reversing camera is standard on Audi e-tron. See also [360 camera](../360camera/)
