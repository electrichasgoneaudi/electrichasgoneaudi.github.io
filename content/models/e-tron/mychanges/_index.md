### Facelift
It was expected that a new e-tron with an increased range would be launched for the 2023 model, but this was delayed, and it was launched on November 9. 2022, as the Audi Q8 e-tron. So 2023 will be the last year of the Audi e-tron.


See [Audi Q8 e-tron](../../../models/q8-e-tron) for details about the new model
