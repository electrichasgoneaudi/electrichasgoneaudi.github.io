Even though these models are in different categories, the price can be in the same range depending on the equipment level. In addition, people might be willing to increase/reduce their budget depending on the value of money and features.

That's why we in this article will go into the detailed difference between the Audi e-tron 55 quattro and the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro

## Introduction

Audi e-tron 55 was presented in September 2018 and is Audi’s first all-electric model. The [MLB-Evo](../../../technology/bev-platforms/mlb-evo/) platform is the basis for this model. Traditional models also use this platform.

In April 2021, Audi presented the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 as the first mid-size SUV.

A dedicated EV platform, called [MEB](../../../technology/bev-platforms/meb/), is used on this model.
This platform was created by Volkswagen and used by several models.

## Consumption

According to the specification, the consumption is 25% higher on Audi e-tron 55 compared to Audi 40 e-tron 50. In reality, you can see up to 35% difference in consumption. The main reasons for this are smaller tires on the Q4 e-tron 50, more efficient motors, less weight, and a smaller size that causes less aerodynamical drag.

## Range

Because of the low consumption, the Q4 e-tron 50 has a better range even though the battery is 12% smaller. As a result, the range difference would, in most driving conditions, be 10-15% better on the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 compared to a similar equipped Audi e-tron 55.

In the real world, depending on weather and driving style, the range on the Audi e-tron 55 would be between 250-450km, while on the Audi Q4 e-tron, the range would be 300-500km in similar conditions.

## Performance

The Audi e-tron 55 has 408 hp, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 299 hp. For the Q4 e-tron 50 quattro, the full power is only available when fully charged and above 23 degrees, while the full power is available in much larger areas for the Audi e-tron. However, since the weight is lower on the Q4 e-tron, the difference feels smaller and is probably small enough not to make it the deciding factor between the models for many.

## Suspension

[Adaptive air suspension](../../e-tron/drivetrain/suspension/) with electronic damping control is standard equipment on the Audi e-tron. Depending on the speed and the driver’s preferences, it individually adjusts the ride height according to the road conditions. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.

Aud Q4 e-tron is only available with standard suspension.

For many, this is a deciding factor.

## Size

The Audi e-tron is 313 mm longer and 81 mm wider than Q4. The smaller size makes the Q4 more flexible in traffic and parking situations.

    </a>
    <figcaption><h4>A typical scenario. Audi e-tron is filling a parking space.</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

The size difference can be a deciding argument for Q4 for many people.

## Cargo capacity

The cargo space is about 27% larger on the e-tron than the Q4. Q4 does not have any frunk, like the Audi e-tron.

e-tron can pull a trailer up to 1800kg, while Q4 only has a 1200kg trailer capacity.

## Exterior

Both Audi e-tron 55 and Audi Q4 e-tron are available with various standard colors, wheels, optics, panoramic roof, s-line exterior, etc.

Audi exclusive colors are available on the Audi e-tron. But it comes at a cost and probably not something that would be a deciding factor.

## Interior

There is a more significant difference for the interior. Both models are available with standard and s sports seats.

Audi e-tron has, in addition, sports seats and individual contour seats.

Individual contour seats are available with massage and ventilation.
Both have options for an S-line interior and multicolor ambient lighting.

Audi e-tron also has interior styling options like a full leather dashboard and glass buttons.

        alt="Individual contour seats in Audi e-tron" title="Individual contour seats in Audi e-tron">
    </a>
    <figcaption><h4>Individual contour seats in Audi e-tron</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, the quality of the materials used in the Audi e-tron is more premium, giving it a more luxurious feeling.

## Charging

Both models have 11KW as standard charging for AC. For DC, the Audi e-tron has 150KW, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 125KW. But the difference is more extensive since the charge curve is market-leading for the Audi e-tron making it one of the fastest charging models.
Audi e-tron has an option for a 22KW charger.

## Driving assistance

Both models are available with almost the same driver-assist systems. However, there is a difference in what is standard. Night vision, intersection assist and pre-sense side is only available on the Audi e-tron.

## Infotainment

For infotainment, there are some differences. Virtual Cockpit and MMI Navigation are standard on the Audi e-tron, while this is an option on the Q4. The MMI system is also different. On the Audi e-tron, there are two screens, while Q4 has only one screen in the center console.

Just one screen has some drawbacks since you lose some functionality available on the second screen and other functionality needs to only use the area on the first screen, like the navigation search.

For some, the physical buttons for the AC on Q4 are an advantage.

    </a>
    <figcaption><h4>One screen Audi MMI touch on Audi Q4 e-tron</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro have an option for Sonos sound system. Audi e-tron has an option for Bang & Olufsen. The Bang & Olufsen is a better sound system but probably not so much better than someone would choose a model just based on this factor.

## Lights

HD matrix is an option on both models. In addition, Q4 has some fabulous new daylight driving lights as an option where drivers can select a different design. For e-tron Digital HD Matrix also is available. 

We don't believe that exterior lights will be a deciding factor for many.

## Noise insulation

The Audi e-tron 55 has better noise insulation. As a result, road noise is better damped on the Audi e-tron. The extra noise insulation is one of the reasons the e-tron is much heavier than the Q4 e-tron.

## Standard equipment

Audi Q4 e-tron 50 has a lower starting price.

Much of this difference is because of standard equipment on the e-tron and not on Q4.

The following equipment is standard on the e-tron 55, but options on the Q4 e-tron 50 quattro

- [e-tron rear light strip](../../q4-e-tron/technology/lights/#striking-taillight-signature-the-light-strip-at-the-rear)

- [Powered tailgate](../../q4-e-tron/exterior/doors/#powered-tailgate)
- [Drive select](../../q4-e-tron/technology/audidriveselect/)
- Adaptive air suspension (not available on the Audi Q4)

In some markets, the base models are not available, and the list with standard equipment in that market can include more on both models.

## Available options

- [22KW AC charging](../../e-tron/technology/onboardcharger/#optional-22kw-charger)
- [Orange painted calibers](../../e-tron/exterior/paintedcalibers/)

If one or more of these options are essential for you, this can be a deciding factor.

## Price

The starting price is significantly lower on the Q4 e-tron 50 than Audi e-tron 55. But different markets have different packages that give various price differences. In markets where the buyers freely can select options, the starting price difference is about $20.000 / £20.000

## So which one should you select?

As typical, it all depends on your different needs and preferences.

### For the one that prefers range and consumption

The Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro is the clear winner for this category. More range and much lower consumption.

### For the family with the need for much storage

The Audi e-tron has a larger cargo capacity and more room for the passenger. Suppose maximum cargo capacity is the deciding factor. Then, the Audi e-tron 55 win this.

### For the ones with a focus on comfort and luxury

With the possibility of individual contour seats with massage and ventilation, adaptive air suspension, and leading sound insulation Audi e-tron wins this.
