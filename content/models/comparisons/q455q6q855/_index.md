Even though these models are in different categories, their prices can be in the same range depending on the equipment level. In addition, people might be willing to increase or reduce their budget depending on the value of money and features.
This article will detail the difference between the Audi Q4 e-tron 55 Quattro, the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 Quattro, and the new Audi Q6 e-tron Quattro.

## Introduction

The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 was presented in [September 2022](../../../articles/e-tron-facelift-q8-etron-2024/) It is an upgrade of Audi’s first all-electric model, the Audi e-tron. It is based on the [MLB-Evo](../../../technology/bev-platforms/mlb-evo/) platform, which is also used in traditional models.

In September 2023, Audi presented the Audi Q4 e-tron 55, upgrade from the 2021 Q4 e-tron 50.

This model uses a dedicated EV platform called [MEB](../../../technology/bev-platforms/meb/), Volkswagen created this platform, which is also used by several other models.
The Audi Q6 e-tron had its world premiere on March 18, 2024, and is built on the [PPE platform](../../../technology/bev-platforms/ppe/) developed
by Porsche and Audi.

## Consumption

According to the specification, the consumption of the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 is 20% higher than that of the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro, while that of the Audi Q4 e-tron 55 is about 3% higher than that of the Q6. In the real world, you can see up to a 35% difference in consumption. The main reasons for this are more efficient motors, less weight, and a smaller size that causes less aerodynamic drag.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/comparisons/q455q6q855/q6_1_st.jpg" width="3000" height="2250" title="Audi Q6 e-tron" >}}


## Range

Because of the low consumption, the Q6 e-tron quattro has a better range even though the battery is 12% smaller. As a result, the range difference would, in most driving conditions, be 15-25% better on the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro compared to a similar equipped Audi Q8 e-tron 55.

In the real world, depending on weather and driving style, the range on the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 would be between 320-550km, while on the Audi Q4 e-tron, the range would be 300-500km in similar conditions.

## Performance

The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 has 408 hp, The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro 382 and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 340 hp. The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro is the most performant model because of its lighter weight and sporty setup.

## Suspension

The Audi Q8 e-tron comes standard with [Adaptive air suspension](../../q8-e-tron/drivetrain/suspension/) with electronic damping control. The ride height is individually adjusted according to road conditions based on speed and the driver's preferences. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.
Adaptive air suspension is an option for Audi Q6 e-tron quattro.
Aud Q4 e-tron is only available with standard suspension. For many, this is a deciding factor.

## Size

The Audi Q8 e-tron is 313 mm longer and 81 mm wider than Q4. The smaller size makes the Q4 more flexible in traffic and parking situations.

Q6 is 20cm longer than Q4 and is placed in between in size.

## Cargo capacity

The cargo space on the Audi Q8 e-tron is about 15% larger than that on the Q4. Unlike the Audi Q8 e-tron and the Q6 e-tron, the Q4 does not have a frunk.

The Q8 e-tron can pull up to 1800kg, while the Q4 has a trailer capacity of only 1200 kg. The Q6, with its 2400kg capacity, is the clear winner when it comes to trailer capacity.

## Exterior

All models have various standard colors, wheels, optics, panoramic roofs, s-line exteriors, etc.

Audi exclusive colors are available on the Audi Q8 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron. But they come at a cost and are probably not a deciding factor.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/comparisons/q455q6q855/q8_1_st.jpg" width="3000" height="2250" title="Audi Q8 e-tron" >}}

## Interior

There is a more significant difference in the interior. All models are available with standard and sports seats.
The Audi Q8 e-tron also has sports seats and individual contour seats.

Individual contour seats with massage and ventilation are available. Both have options for an S-line interior and multicolor ambient lighting.

The Audi Q8 e-tron has interior styling options like a full leather dashboard and glass buttons.

In addition, the quality of the materials used in the Audi Q8 e-tron is more premium, giving it a more luxurious feeling.

## Charging

All models have 11KW as standard AC charging. For DC, the Audi Q8 e-tron has 170KW, the Q6 e-tron 270KW, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 175KW. The Audi Q8 e-tron has an option for a 22KW AC charger.

## Driving assistance

All models have almost the same driver-assist systems. However, there is a difference in what is standard. Intersection assist and pre-sense side are only available on the Audi Q8 e-tron.

## Infotainment

There are some differences in infotainment.  Virtual Cockpit and MMI Navigation are standard on the Audi Q8 e-tron, while this is an option on the Q4. The MMI system is also different. On the Audi Q8 e-tron, there are two screens, while Q4 has only one screen in the center console.

The Audi Q6 uses a brand new systems with a "Digital Stage" and a large shared screen. It also have optional passenger screen. 

This system is much more updated and modern than in Q4 and Q8.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/q6-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/mmi/mmi_3_st.jpg" width="3000" height="2077" title="Audi Q6 e-tron with virtual cockpit, MMI screen, and MMI front passenger screen" >}}

Audi Q4 e-tron 55 quattro have an option for Sonos sound system. Audi Q8 e-tron and Q6 e-tron have an option for Bang & Olufsen. The Bang & Olufsen is a better sound system but probably not so much better than someone who would choose a model just based on this factor.

## Lights

HD matrix is an option on all models. In addition, Q4 and Q6 has some fabulous new daylight driving lights as an option where drivers can select a different design. For Q8 e-tron Digital HD Matrix also is available. 

We don't believe that exterior lights will be a deciding factor for many.

## Noise insulation

The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 has better noise insulation. As a result, road noise is better damped on the Audi Q8 e-tron. The extra noise insulation is one of the reasons the Q8 e-tron is much heavier than the Q4 e-tron. The Q6 is at almost the same level as Q8 when it comes to noise insulation.

## Standard equipment

Audi Q4 e-tron 55 has a lower starting price.

Much of this difference is due to the standard equipment used compared to the other models.

The following equipment is standard on the Q8 e-tron 55 / Q6 e-tron, but options on the Q4 e-tron 55 quattro

- [e-tron rear light strip](../../q4-e-tron/technology/lights/#striking-taillight-signature-the-light-strip-at-the-rear)  (standard Q8)

In some markets, the base models are not available, and the list with standard equipment in that market can include more on both models.

## Available options

- [Orange painted calibers](../../q8-e-tron/exterior/paintedcalibers/)

If one or more of these options are essential for you, this can be a deciding factor.

## Price

The starting price is significantly lower on the Q4 e-tron 50 than Audi e-tron 55. But different markets have different packages that give various price differences. In markets where the buyers freely can select options, the starting price difference is about $20.000 / £20.000

## So which one should you select?

As typical, it all depends on your different needs and preferences.

### For the one that prefers range and consumption

The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro is the clear winner for this category: more range and much lower consumption.

### For the family with the need for maximum storage capacity

The Audi Q8 e-tron has a larger cargo capacity and more passenger room. If maximum cargo capacity is the deciding factor, then the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 wins this.

### For the ones with a focus on comfort and luxury

The Audi Q8 e-tron wins this because it offers the possibility of individual contour seats with massage and ventilation, adaptive air suspension, and leading sound insulation.
