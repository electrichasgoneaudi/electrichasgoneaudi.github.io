## The comfort auxiliary air conditioning

The comfort auxiliary air conditioning cools or heats the interior to a desired temperature before driving. So
A very high level of climate comfort is achieved as soon as you get into the vehicle.

If further optional equipment is available at an additional cost, such as seat heating, steering wheel heating and glass surface heating have been selected, these can also be activated. The comfort auxiliary air conditioning can be planned and planned specifically by entering a departure time immediately before the start of the journey. The desired temperature can be individually adjusted.

The functions can be conveniently programmed and activated via the MMI touch in the vehicle or via the myAudi app5, 10. The comfort auxiliary air conditioning works regardless of whether the car is currently being charged via the charging infrastructure or not – provided that the high-voltage battery has a sufficiently high charge level. When the vehicle is unlocked with the remote control key, “brief air conditioning” can also be started.
