The body’s clean design focuses on dynamism, progressiveness, and elegance. The front is simultaneously harmonious and expressive. The slim design of the daytime running lights and the wide grille make the A6 e-tron appear flat and wide on the road.

A black mask surrounds the closed and inverted single frame, reflecting the distinct design language of the e-tron models. The main headlights and other functional elements, such as the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) sensors and the air intakes, are integrated into the dark mask, making them almost invisible.

The dynamic roofline of the A6 e-tron rests on a powerful foundation with a low ride height. The quattro blisters are those contours that emphasize the quattro drive with their sculptural and muscular shape. They are a core element of the Audi design DNA. As the heart of the car, the battery is emphasized by a black insert in the sill area. The insert gives the car a flat, slim, and dynamic appearance from the side. It extends to the rear and integrates the reflectors, giving the A6 e-tron a visually stretched appearance. The Avant is also characterized by a very flat roofline, with the D-pillar sloping steeply forward. An aluminum-look trim piece from the A-pillar to the roof spoiler is a new, distinctive feature of the A6 Avant e-tron and creates a high recognizability.

The rear conveys a mixture of sporty elegance and full power. The clean architecture, combined with the continuous and three-dimensional light strip, gives the new A6 e-tron clarity and aplomb. A striking spoiler lip finishes off the rear of the Sportback, and the eye-catching rear diffuser further emphasizes the sporty and dynamic look of the rear.

The Audi A6 e-tron comes with 19-inch five-arm dynamic wheels, designed as aero wheels, as standard while the S line gets 20-inch “five-spoke tripod” wheels in graphite gray. The S6 e-tron comes with 20-inch wheels as standard. Stunning wheels up to 21 inches are available as an option. Nine distinctive designs - from sporty to elegant, are available, including six from Audi Sport.

The exterior of the Audi A6 e-tron differs between the variants basic, S line and S model. Up to eight exterior colors are available at market launch.
