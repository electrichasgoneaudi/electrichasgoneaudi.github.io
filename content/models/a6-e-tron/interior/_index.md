 The three-dimensional and high-contrast design deliberately places elements in the foreground or background, creating a spatial architecture tailored to the occupants in terms of design and ergonomics. The MMI panoramic display, with its curved design and OLED technology, consists of the 11.9-inch Audi virtual cockpit and the 14.5-inch MMI touch display and, together with the 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display, forms a digital stage with visually clear design.

Active Privacy Mode allows the front seat passenger to enjoy entertainment content while traveling, such as watching movies or streaming series, without distracting the driver. Depending on the current speed, and seat occupancy, the light is directed (privacy mode on) or diffused (content visible to all).

Audi is taking a significant step forward in display technology with the optional augmented reality head-up display (AR HuD), another central element of the digital stage.

The display reflects a large, tilted image plane across the windshield towards the driver. It shows relevant information such as speed, traffic signs, assistance, and navigation symbols.

The interior creates a homely ambiance. The “soft wrap” extends from door to door across the entire panel width, creating a homogeneous and enveloping feeling of space. The materials were selected from a functional perspective. At the same time, they ensure a clear design differentiation of the various areas in the vehicle’s interior. Comfort-oriented areas are designed with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control areas in high-quality, high-gloss black emphasize the clarity of interaction with the vehicle. The low-lying, slim air vents seem to disappear into the background. The displays of the optional virtual exterior mirrors are located inside the doors, clearly visible in the angle of the A-pillar and the door sill.

A digital wrap is also created here, which extends from mirror to mirror across the entire digital instrument panel and is connected via the dynamic interaction light at the base of the windshield. Essential functions such as mirror adjustment, lighting, and locking systems are integrated compactly into the central control panel in the driver's door. An optional four-zone automatic air conditioning system completes the elegant ambiance.

The interior offers plentiful storage space and various compartments. The center console includes two cup holders, a cell phone charger, and a storage compartment below the armrest with over five liters of capacity. The trunk provides 502 liters of storage space in both the Avant and Sportback models. Folding down the rear seat bench increases the storage capacity to 1,422 liters in the Avant and 1,330 liters in the Sportback. The standard front luggage compartment (frunk) under the hood offers an extra 27 liters of space, ideal for small travel bags. The towing capacity is 2,100 kilograms.
