The Audi A6 e-tron was first time revealed in April 2021 as a concept car. It is expected to have a world premiere July 31. 2024 and will be the sixth all-electric model from Audi. With a range of up to 700km, it will be the all-electric model with the longest range from Audi.

March 17. 2022 Audi also presented the Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept of this model.

## Exterior, size, and design

Even though this is a concept, Audi promises that this concept will look very similar to the production-ready model. At 4.96 meters (16.3 ft.) long, 1.96 meters (6.4 ft.) wide, and 1.44 meters (4.7 ft.) high, its body puts it in the luxury class. Its lines are a consistent development in Audi’s contemporary formal language. Significant elements like the closed Singleframe and the continuous strip of lights in the rear emphasize its kinship with the other electrically powered Audis in the e-tron fleet.

Large 22-inch wheels and short overhangs, the flat cabin, and a dynamic roof arch give the Avant proportions that are distinctly reminiscent of a sports car.

Audi A6 e-tron will be available with S-line exterior, black optics, black windows, virtual mirrors, panoramic roof, several wheels to choose from with sizes from 19" to 22", many different colors including the possibility for Audi exclusive colors making it possible to create your unique design.

## Interior

Audi A6 e-tron will be available with different seat options. From standard seats, sports seats, and comfort seats. Some with the possibility for ventilation and massage. 
It will also be available with an animal-free interior and a full leather interior with different colors. An s-line interior will also be available.

## Drivetrain

Audi A6 e-tron is based on the new [PPE-platform](../../technology/bev-platforms/ppe/) that is co-created with Porsche and will come with both 2-wheel drive and quattro versions and with at least two different battery sizes.

### Battery & Range

It will be delivered in two battery sizes

- 12 modules with 100 kWh gross (94kWh net)
- 10 modules with 83.3kWh gross (78kWh net).

This will give the Audi A6 e-tron a WLTP range of approximately 520-700km depending on the trim level for the biggest battery. (13.4 - 18 kWh/100km)

The battery will have an 800-Volt architecture for high-performance charging up to 270KW for DC charging. 300km charging takes as little as 10 minutes.

The expectation is that the Audi A6 e-tron will come in different versions.

- Rear- wheel drive Audi A6 e-tron / Audi A6 Avant e-tron with small battery 
- Rear-wheel drive Audi A6 / Audi A6 Avant performance e-tron with large battery (the version with longest range)
- Audi A6 quattro / Audi A6 Avant e-tron quattro with large battery 
- Audi S6 Avant e-tron with 517HP
- Audi RS6 Avant e-tron with 640 HP

The concept version has 469HP and 800 nm torque. 

Audi will use different motor setups on the different variants.

### Suspension

Audi A6 e-tron will be available with Adaptive Air suspension.

## Technology

### UI & MMI

Audi A6 e-tron will come with a new generation MMI.

It will be based on  [Android Automotive](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive) and will feature
a larger horizontal display mounted on the dashboard and virtual cockpit.

### Lights technology

Digital Matrix LED and digital OLED technology make it possible to achieve maximum brightness and a wide range of features even with a minimal surface area, while at the same time offering customizable light signatures. The team of Audi lighting designers and developers has once again done an amazing job – this concept car packs a host of new features and personalization options into its lighting units. Most of them are expected to be available in the production model.

Three small, high-resolution LED projectors are built into each side of the body, transforming the ground beneath them into a stage when the doors are opened – small, extended, dynamic lighting effects greet the occupants with messages in their own language.

The combination of safety features and aesthetic design is particularly important to Audi. That’s why the small, high-resolution projectors also display warning symbols on the ground – to warn a bike rider that the car door is about to open, for example.

Another four high-resolution LED projectors – inconspicuously integrated into the corners of the vehicle – generate turn signal projections. The design of these projections can be modified to address different markets and approval regions as required.

The Digital Matrix LED front headlights achieve almost cinematic quality. If, for example, the Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept is parked in front of a wall during a break to recharge the battery, the driver and passengers can pass the time playing a video game projected onto it. Instead of on a small screen in the cockpit, they’ll see their current game’s virtual landscapes projected onto the wall in XXL format – and all this via the Digital Matrix LED headlights.

### Driver Assistance

Audi A6 e-tron will be available with different driver assistance packages. Many will be standard while others are options. 
Systems include Audi Cruise Assist, Audi active lane assist, Audi pre sense, and many many more.

## Options

Audi A6 e-tron will be available with several options. Audi plans to reduce the number of combinations of options. So instead of most options being offered separately like the Audi e-tron, they will introduce options packages.
