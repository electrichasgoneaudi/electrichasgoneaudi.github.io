Audi Q8 e-tron is built on the same MLB-Evo platform that Audi e-tron with the support of up to 3 powerful motors and a new larger batteries. Adaptive Air suspension and progressive steering are standard.

It is expected that the battery will be available in two sizes.

The Q8 e-tron 55 will have the same battery as e-tron 55 but will have a reduced buffer and with improved effiency it will get and WLTP range up to 500km. (up from 452km)
This based on 89kWh available battery and a WLTP consumption of 17.8kWh/100km.

The assumption is that the Audi Q8 e-tron 65 will keep the same nominal voltage (396 volts) as the Audi e-tron and therefore the same amount of cells but each cell will be slightly larger
moving from 60AH to 67AH. At the same time, the buffer is expected to be reduced to 6%, the same as Q4 e-tron and expected on Q6 e-tron.

This should give the following batteries (unconfirmed)

- 105.6 kWh gross / 99 kWh net on Audi Q8 e-tron 65

This will give the new Audi Q8 e-tron 65 a WLTP range between 400km and 450km (248 miles - 280 miles). (up from 343km-374km on Audi e-tron S)(213 - 232 miles).
