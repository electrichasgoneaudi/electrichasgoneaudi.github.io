## Audi Q8 e-tron drivetrain: battery and motors

The Audi Q8 e-tron is built on the same MLB-Evo platform that the Audi e-tron, with the support of up to 3 powerful motors and new larger batteries. As on the Audi e-tron, adaptive Air suspension and progressive steering are standard.

### Batteries

As on the Audi e-tron, the battery will be available in two sizes.
The Q8 e-tron 50 is expected to have the same battery size as the Audi e-tron 55 

- 95kWh gross / 86.6 kWh net

The assumption is that the Audi Q8 e-tron 55/ Audi Q8 e-tron S will keep the same nominal voltage (396 volts) as the Audi e-tron and, therefore, the same amount of cells, but each cell will be slightly larger, moving from 60AH to 72AH.
These cells should give the following battery (unconfirmed)

- 115 kWh gross / 105 kWh net

### Range & efficiency

Improved aerodynamics and updated power electronics should improve efficiency. But not much since the models will be heavier because of larger batteries. The table below assumes a reduced consumption of 0.5kWh/100km compared to the Audi e-tron.

|Model | WLTP Consumption | WLTP Range   |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
|Audi Q8 e-tron 50| 18.9 - 22.5 kWh/100km | 390 - 460 km |
|Audi Q8 e-tron 55 | 19.1 - 23 kWh/100km | 456 - 550 km |
|Audi Q8 e-tron S | 22.6 - 24.7 kWh/100km | 425 - 464 km |
|Audi Q8 e-tron Sportback 50 | 18.3 - 22.5 kWh/100km | 450 - 380 km |
|Audi Q8 e-tron Sportback 55 | 18.6 - 22.7 kWh/100km | 462 - 565 km |
|Audi Q8 e-tron Sportback S | 22.3 - 24.4 kWh/100km | 425 - 464 km|
