Audi built the Audi Q8 e-tron on an extensively adapted variant of the modular longitudinal platform (MLB Evo).

The MLB Evo platform is a shared platform that includes ICE, like Lamborghini URUS and Audi A8.

But Audi created an entirely new dedicated chassis and body for the e-tron. As a result, you can’t compare with other EVs like VW Golf or others that use modified ICE chassis that negatively affect range and design.

Its foundation is a new body shape with numerous innovative structural elements in the lower area of the vehicle center and the roof.

Audi improved the drivetrain for the Audi Q8 e-tron with larger batteries, improved motors, steering, aerodynamics, and steering.
