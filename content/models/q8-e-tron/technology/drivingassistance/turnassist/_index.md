Monitoring is initiated as soon as the driver sets the turn signal. When driving off from a stop, or during slow driving up to a speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph), the system can intervene by applying the brakes to prevent the car from colliding with an oncoming vehicle when turning left or right (country-dependent). This brake intervention keeps the vehicle within its own driving lane. The driver is informed of the intervention by an indicator in the instrument cluster.

This option is part of the tour driver assistance package with option id **PCC**
