 The warnings are made when the distance to a detected object in the path of driving is less than 90 cm (35.4 in) – depending on the specific model – after the driver has engaged reverse gear and activated the system by pushing a button on the center console. Ultrasonic sensors inconspicuously integrated into the bumpers measure the distance. The MMI display depicts it visually. A white segment shows a detected object outside of the driving path. Red segments represent detected objects within the driving path. The virtual driving path display also shows lateral guide lines which are precalculated based on the currently selected steering input and thereby assists in convenient parking and exiting. Increasing frequency of the audible warning indicates that the distance to the obstacle is decreasing. At around 30 cm (11.8 in) distance to the detected object, the driver hears a constant tone – the signal to stop.

 Parking system plus is standard equipment on the Audi Q8 e-tron.
