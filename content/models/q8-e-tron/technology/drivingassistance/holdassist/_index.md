 The system automatically switches over to the electromechanical parking brake when the car is stopped for a longer period of time while hold assist is activated. This ensures that the car will remain stationary even without activation of the parking brake. After a stop at a traffic light, for instance, the car drives off as soon as the driver presses the accelerator pedal. The system is activated in MMI in the following menu.

MMI -> Car - > Setting & Service -> Hold assist -> on/off

Hold assist is standard equipment on Audi Q8 e-tron
