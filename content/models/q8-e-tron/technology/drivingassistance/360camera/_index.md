A virtual overhead view shown in the MMI display gives the driver an overview of the overall parking situation. The panoramic view to the front and rear covers an angle of nearly 180 degrees and provides better visibility when exiting tight parking spaces, courtyard entrances and confusing intersections. Guide lines in the reversing camera view make it easier to park in perpendicular spaces and to hitch trailers. The view from the front camera helps when maneuvering, as it detects obstacles in front of the car. The system is automatically activated when driving in reverse or by pushing a button.

An additional feature for some models is a virtual 3D view. The driver can use the touchscreen to steplessly swivel and zoom the image of the car and the actual vehicle surroundings. There is also a view of the front or rear tires so that the driver can pull the car up right next to the curb.
