 At speeds up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph), it initiates a short braking action when needed. Crossing assist is active at vehicle speeds up to 30 km/h (18.6 mph). It uses data from the zFAS central computer, with the most important information here supplied by the mid-range radars and the laser scanner. 

If the driver wants to ease into an intersection or exit with poor visibility, he or she can push the parking button. This sends the images from the 360 degree cameras to the MMI monitor. They drastically expand the field of view, and the driver can choose from among multiple views.
