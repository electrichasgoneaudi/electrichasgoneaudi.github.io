The system uses data from the two radar sensors and the front camera for this purpose. In calculating a suitable evasive maneuver corridor, it takes into account the distance, width and offset of the vehicle driving ahead. Collision avoidance assist is available over a speed range from approx. 30 to 150 km/h (18.6 to 93.2 mph), and it assumes that the driver is actively steering throughout the maneuver. The driver is informed of the intervention by an indicator in the instrument cluster.

First, a jolt is produced to warn the driver of the hazard. If the driver then actively avoids the obstacle, the assistant applies a slight steering torque that helps by correcting the driver’s steering input or helping to make a lane change. Models like the Audi e-tron use a specific braking of individual wheels – with it the vehicle is made to follow the computed course.
