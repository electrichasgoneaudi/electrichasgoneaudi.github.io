## Standard key

The standard key on Audi e-tron is equipped with Keyless Go. This means that the engine start authorization is released without actively actuating the key. 

To do this, the driver must sit in the vehicle and carry the convenience key with him.

The engine is started and switched off using the engine start-stop button in the center console.

## Advance key option PGC

The advance/convenience key offers convenient control of access and engine start authorization without the key having to be actively operated

By operating the door handle, the vehicle can be opened without actively using the key. This is possible with all doors. The access authorization is confirmed by wireless communication between the key and the vehicle. 

To lock the vehicle from the outside, all you have to do is touch one of the sensor buttons on all door handles. 

The luggage compartment lid can be conveniently unlocked using the luggage compartment button on the convenience key or, if you do not have a free hand, with a foot gesture (kick movement) at the rear.
