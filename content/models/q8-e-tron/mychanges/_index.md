### Facelift

It was expected that a new e-tron with increased range would be launched for the 2023 model. This has been postponed. Probably because of the supply issues in the world. 

This is the first real facelift version of e-tron.

To make the naming logical Audi has decied to rename it to Audi Q8 e-tron.

So 2023 will be the last year of Audi e-tron.

See [Audi Q8 e-tron](../../../models/q8-e-tron) for details about the new model.
