The drive portfolio of the two compact electric models lives up to the expectations of very different groups of customers – from the urban commuter to the long-distance driver. It includes two battery variants and three drive variants. The compact battery for the Q4 35 e-tron has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross), while the figures for the large battery in the Q4 40 e-tron and Q4 50 e-tron quattro are 77 (82) kWh.

## Thermal management

The thermal management system aims to get the battery up to the ideal temperature range of around 30 degrees Celsius quickly after it is started and to keep it there until the end of the journey. This ensures that its full power – and therefore the power of the entire drive system – is available after a short time even in extremely cold conditions. Thanks to the stable thermal conditions, the driver can also call on it repeatedly or charge the battery at an HPC charging terminal with high output. The sophisticated thermal management system also gives the battery a long life cycle – Audi guarantees that it will still have at least 70 percent capacity after eight years of operation or after 160,000 kilometers.

## Charging performance Audi Q4 e-tron

The first generation of Audi Q4 e-tron had a max charging speed of 100KW for the Q4 e-tron 35 and 125KW for the Audi Q4 e-tron 40/45/50 with the charging curve below.

In March 2022, Audi revealed that they upgraded the charging speed and the charging curve for the Audi Q4 e-tron 40/45 and 50.

All these cars will now charge up to 135 kW of power. As a result, the ideal 5 to 80 percent charge time is reduced for the Q4 40 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback 40 e-tron to 29 minutes, for the Q4 45 e-tron quattro and the Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro models to 36 minutes.

It is currently not known if the existing cars will get an upgrade to the new charging curve.

## Battery lifetime

Audi guarantees that it will still have at least 70 percent capacity after eight years of operation or after 160,000 kilometers.
