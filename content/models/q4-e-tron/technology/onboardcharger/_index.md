The onboard charger is responsible for converting AC to DC.

There are two versions of the onboard charger. The charger in Q4 35 support 7.2KW AC charging (KB2) while 40/45 and 50 support 11KW AC charging (KB3)

In the US the charging port has a [J1772 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_J1772) to connect to the car, while in Europe it has a [Type 2 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector).
