## Standard key

Keyless Go is standard on the Audi Q4 e-tron.

Keyless Go releases make it possible to start the engine without actively actuating the key.

The driver must sit in the vehicle and carry the convenience key.

The engine starts when pressing the brake pedal and setting the car in gear. It stops when the driver leaves the vehicle. The driver can also use the start/stop button to start/stop the ignition.

## Advance key option 4K5

In addition to keyless go, the advance/convenience key offers keyless entry.

The driver can open the vehicle by operating the door handle without actively using the key.

Keyless entry is possible with all doors. Wireless communication between the key and the vehicle confirms the access authorization.

To lock the vehicle from the outside, you must touch one of the sensor buttons on all door handles.

When the Audi Q4 e-tron is equipped with the [powered tailgate option](../../exterior/doors/#powered-tailgate), the luggage compartment lid can be conveniently unlocked using the luggage compartment button on the convenience key.

If you do not have a free hand, you can use a foot gesture (kick movement) at the rear.

## Advance key in combination with function package 1 option 4K6

If you buy the convenience key in combination with function package 1 you get the same functionality as above, but you also get Safelock.

Safelock prevents the doors from being opened from the inside when locked.

This option also includes an Anti-theft alarm system with an interior sensor.

## Settings

You can configure the locking system in Audi Q4 e-tron MMI.
