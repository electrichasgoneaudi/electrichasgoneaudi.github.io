#### Drive

The drive system will react to accelerator pedal moves more quickly or in a more balanced manner.

#### Steering

The power steering will adapt. Light steering is suitable for long trips on highways or smooth driving around curves, for example. 

#### Suspension

The suspension adjusts to be tighter or more comfort-oriented when it comes to compensating for uneven spots on the road. 
This requires **PY9** that includes damper control.
