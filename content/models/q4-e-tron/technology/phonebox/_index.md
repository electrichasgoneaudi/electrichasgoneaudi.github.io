The smart phone can be charged and stored safely in the universal holder in the front of the car. The holder is connected to the car's antenna for better reception and voice quality. In addition, the radiation from the mobile phone in the passenger compartment is reduced, as the phone needs less transmission power. The holder is 170 x 87 mm. This also allows larger smartphones to fit in it. As more and more mobile phones can be charged wirelessly, the Audi phone box is equipped with an inductive charging function (Qi standard) in addition to the USB port. The charge level is shown on the MMI display. If you leave the car while the phone is in the holder, an alert is triggered

The MMI display that reminds you to bring your phone.
