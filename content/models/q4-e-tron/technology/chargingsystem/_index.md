The Charging System Compact is not the charger, technically speaking. This equipment is known as [EVSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station) (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) and serves as a
controller that ensures safe power delivery between your home and the vehicle. Every Audi Q4 e-tron comes equipped with this charging system as standard.

For Levels 1 (120 volt AC) and Level 2 (230/400 volt AC), the actual charging process takes place via the vehicle’s own [on-board charger](../onboardcharger/). The onboard charger converts AC power from your home into
DC power, which is what batteries use to store and supply energy.

It is meant for use when a fixed level 2 or level 3 installation is not available and you need to charge your Q4 e-tron from a domestic or industrial AC socket.

In the US the charging system has a [J1772 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_J1772) to connect to the car, while in Europe it has a [Type 2 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector).

## e-tron charging System Compact

The charging system compact is the standard system provided with e-tron.

It comes in different versios based on the country it sells. In some countries in Europe you can choose
between a 230-volt system and a 400-volt system when ordering the car.

## Capacity based on network / outlet

| Connection | Plug  | capacity | charging 100%  q4 e-tron 40/50 |
| ------| ------| ---- |------- |
| 120Volt | Level 1 Domestic NEMA 5-20 | 1.2kW |  76 hours |
| 240Volt | Domestic NEMA 14-50 | 9.6kW |  9.5 hours |
| 230Volt | Domestic Type F | 1.8kW |  43 hours |
| 400V 16A 3phase | Red Industrial |  11KW | 9 hours |
| 230V 32A 1phase | Blue Industrial |  7.2KW | 11.5 hours |
| 230V 16A 1phase | Blue Industrial |  3.6KW | 23 hours |

## Use with caution

For home use, it is highly recommended  that you use a fixed installed wall charger to reduce the risk of fire. Domestic outlets typically are not created for supporting high current over many hours like EV charging.

That's why the portable charging system often is called an "emergency charging system".

Using the same outlet over time causes stress to the outlet and there is a high risk for a meltdown. Below you see some pictures of outlets that melted for e-tron owners that did not
install a hardwired charging system. This is not a specific Audi issue, but relevant for all EVs that charge with high current.

For home use you should install a hardwired charging solution. There exist many providers of these type of equipment.

They run on 230/240 or 400 volt depending on network in your home.
