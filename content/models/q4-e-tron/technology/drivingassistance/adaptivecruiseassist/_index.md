The adaptive cruise assist supports the driver in accelerating, braking, maintaining speed and distance, and lane guidance.

Adaptive cruise assist can increase driving comfort, especially on long journeys. The system recognizes lane markings, side structures, vehicles in adjacent lanes, and several cars in front within system limits. From this information, the system derives a virtual driving path.

With an assisting steering intervention, the system helps to keep the vehicle permanently in the center of the lane. At the same time, the set speed is kept constant, and the system reacts to cars in front with distance control.

Thanks to the many parameters involved, the adaptive driving assistant offers the most comfortable driving in the speed range from 0 to the maximum speed of the Audi Q4 e-tron and traffic jams.

The adaptive driver assistant uses the radar sensor installed in the front of the vehicle, the front camera, and the ultrasonic sensors to permanently monitor the area around the car.

The steering wheel also supports the system, sensing if the driver holds the steering wheel or not. 

## Usage

You enable the Adaptive cruise assist by pressing the set speed button on the end of the cruise control stalk to follow the current speed or pulling the cruise control stalk to resume the previous set speed.

You can increase and reduce the set speed from the cruise control stalk in steps 1 or 10 km/h.
You can also control the distance to the car in front of you from the cruise control stalk.

The distance can be controlled from approx 1 to 3.6 seconds in 5 different steps. The virtual cockpit and the optional head-up display show the distance set.

## Predictive control

With predictive control, [efficiency assist](../predictiveefficiencyassist/) adapts the set speed in adaptive cruise control based on detected speed limits and the upcoming route.

Once the system no longer detects any incidents, adaptive cruise control will accelerate back up to the last speed that the driver set.

### Speed limits

If you enable predictive control for speed-limiting adaptive cruise assist will adjust the speed according to the speed limit documented in the navigation system or speed read from signs along the road.

Thee are three options;

- Off
- On
- With tolerance

### Adaption to the route ahead

Adaptive cruise assist can use information from the navigation system to adapt to the route ahead. 

These could be curves, intersections, or roundabouts.
Adaptive cruise assist would reduce speed and return to the set speed when you have passed the specific area.

If you have set a navigation target, it would also reduce speed before an intersection where you need to take off the road you are driving on.
