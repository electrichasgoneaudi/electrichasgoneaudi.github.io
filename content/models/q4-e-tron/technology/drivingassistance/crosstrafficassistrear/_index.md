It uses the rear radar sensors for this. They cover the zone at the rear, including the driving lanes to the left and right behind the vehicle. The warnings are progressive – initially a visual warning is shown in the MMI display (in the park assist display). The situation is represented in a virtual top view and in the “rear” and “rear side” camera views. Red arrows behind the vehicle point in the direction from which there is a potential hazard. If the driver does not react to the visual display, an audible signal sounds before the system warns the driver with a brake jolt. This helps to avoid accidents while exiting parking spaces.

This is part of the security package plus with option id **PYU**
