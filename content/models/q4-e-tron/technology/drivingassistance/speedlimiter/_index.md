linktitle: Speed limiter
description: Audi Q4 e-tron is equipped with a speed limiter. The configurable speed limiter limits driving speed to a value set by the driver within the speed range of 30 to 250 km/h (18.6 to 155.3 mph) â€“ which is very helpful within city limits or construction zones, for example.

 When the preset limit is reached, the vehicle gently throttles the speed down. The speed limit is not exceeded even if the driver applies more pressure to the accelerator pedal. However, the driver can temporarily override the limit by kick-down, and the speed limiter can be completely deactivated at any time from the steering column stalk. The speed that has been preset is shown in the instrument cluster.
