Depending on the equipment, the system can access data from the navigation system, the camera behind the windscreen, and the radar sensors.

The efficiency assist function can be ajdustet individually. The settings depend on the equipment fitted on the Audi Q4 e-tron.

### Recuperation

When you have switched on automatic recuperation, on the MMI, and take your foot off the accelerator, the efficiency assist controls the recuperation and coasting phases depending on the situation.

### Predictive Messages

The driver is shown corresponding information in the instrument cluster or in the Audi virtual cockpit and the head-up display as soon as it would be sensible to take the foot off the right-hand pedal.

Symbols for speed limits, bends, roundabouts, towns, or downhill slopes that indicate to the driver to slow down are displayed on the basis of the route data and recognition of traffic signs.

### Predictive control

If the adaptive cruise assist is switched on or the adaptive cruise control is activated, efficiency assist regulates actively. It decelerates and accelerates predictively and adapts the speed to the course of the road and the traffic situation, also taking vehicles driving in front into account. If the driver so wishes, the system controls the freewheeling and coasting operation of the engine in cooperation with other control units. 

The predictive system always maintains a driving style that reflects the driving program selected – from efficient to sporty – and uses scope for recuperation in the Audi e-tron.

The driver can override the system at any time by accelerating and braking. In addition, drivers can individually activate, deactivate and configure many of their detailed functions in the MMI. Depending on the model, the control, for example, can be adapted to the course of the road in three stages: slow, medium or fast.

### Event symbols

The following symbols may appear dependiong on the equipment fitted. The efficiency assist displays each symbol to indicate the event to which it is currently reaching. Some symbols only appear when predictive mesages is activated and some only appear when the predictive control and the adaptive cruise assist are activated.
