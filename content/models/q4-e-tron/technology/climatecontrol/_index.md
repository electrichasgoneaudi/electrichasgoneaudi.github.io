In the front, this means that the passenger and driver can have individual set temperatures.

## Auxiliary air conditioner with preconditioner

Audi e-tron is equipped with an auxiliary air conditioner that can be used when the car is turned off. This can be activated
from the MMI manually or set by a timer. One typical use case is when charging since the car needs to be turned off then and the main AC unit does not work.

The auxiliary air conditioner can also be controlled by the myAudi app. This is useful when you need to heat or cool the car before using it.

## Auxiliary air conditioner with extra convenience

As an option you can get Auxiliary air conditioner with extra convenience

When using the pre-condition functionality you can also heat the steering wheel and front seats if your car have those options.

## Heatpump

The heat pump reuses heat from the drivetrain to heat the coupe efficiently.

This can reduce consumption in cold weather and by that increase the range. How much this help would vary on the weather.

Has option Id **9M3** but it is only available as part of the [climate- and winter-package](/models/q4-e-tron/optionguide/list/#equipment-packages) **WNW**
