## Double-spoke leather steering with paddles option 2ZQ

The double-spoke leather steering wheel sits comfortably in the hand and the progressive and distinctive steering wheel design in aluminum optics integrates seamlessly into the interior of the vehicle.

The height and distance of the steering wheel can be adjusted manually. To simple operation of the extensive standard and optional infotainment features, the steering wheel is equipped with multifunction buttons with touch controls. Shift paddles allow you to change gear manually.
The recuperation levels can also be changed manually using the rocker switches. When the driver's foot
takes off the accelerator pedal, kinetic energy can be converted into electricity by means of recuperation, depending on the situation and needs. This can in turn be used to charge the battery, which leads to increased efficiency
and increased range.
The three selectable recuperation levels allow adaptation to individual needs and differ
due to the delay and the amount of energy recovered as a result. In the maximum recuperation level,
Moving the vehicle almost exclusively with the accelerator pedal and without using the brake, the one-pedal feeling can also be experienced. In the minimum level, recuperation is completely deactivated and the vehicle rolls comfortably in the “coasting” mode. The selection of this steering wheel requires the selection of further equipment packages.
Note: can only be ordered in conjunction with steering wheel heating (AI9)
