## Audi Concept C: A New Era of Clarity, Emotion, and Electric Performance

The **Audi Concept C** is the first tangible expression of Audi’s new design philosophy. Road-approved and fully electric, the two-seat roadster embodies four defining principles that will shape the brand’s future: **clarity, emotional appeal, technical excellence, and intelligent design**. More than a show car, the Concept C offers a realistic preview of how these values will soon be experienced from behind the wheel.

The concept made its public debut in Milan in early September, followed shortly by an appearance at a dedicated stand at the IAA Mobility show in Munich. From the outset, the Audi Concept C impressed with its striking balance of precision and emotion—signaling a clear evolution of Audi’s design language.

## Highlights

- First manifestation of Audi’s new design philosophy  
- Unmistakable character defined by a unique design language, uncompromising quality, and strong perceived value  
- Vertical frame inspired by the historic Auto Union Type C forms the heart of the new Audi identity  
- Innovative roof concept combining the elegance of a coupé with an open-top driving experience  
- Light used as a sculptural element, introducing Audi’s new four-element light signature

## A Vision of a Future Electric Sports Car

As a street-legal concept vehicle, the Audi Concept C previews a future production model: an all-electric sports car that places **design, performance, and emotional driving** at its core. The roadster blends the exhilaration of open-top driving with the visual solidity of a closed body.

An electrically retractable hardtop—used on an Audi roadster for the first time—consists of two roof elements. This solution allows the vehicle to retain a monolithic body shape when closed, while delivering a genuine open-air experience when retracted.

## Exterior Design: Athletic Minimalism and a New Brand Face

The Audi Concept C introduces a bold and unmistakable identity defined by **athletic minimalism**. Its proportions are shaped by a central battery layout, resulting in a long wheelbase, a rearward-positioned cabin, and a confident, planted stance.

### The Vertical Frame

At the front, the newly interpreted **vertical frame** becomes the defining design element from which the entire vehicle volume develops. Inspired by the Auto Union Type C (1936) and the third-generation Audi A6 (2004), the upright form conveys presence and continuity while integrating forward-looking technology and prominently framing the Audi rings.

A strong shoulder line defines the vehicle’s volume, while clean rear surfaces and horizontal slats emphasize the Concept C’s sporty character.

### A Distinctive Light Signature

The Audi Concept C introduces a new lighting identity with **four horizontally arranged elements** in both the headlights and rear lights. This four-element signature will define Audi’s visual presence during both day and night, ensuring instant recognition.

The exterior color, *Titanium*, reflects warm technical elegance and draws inspiration from the metal’s strength, precision, and lightness.

## Interior: Where Technology Meets Emotion

Inside, the Audi Concept C creates a refined and architectural environment that clearly positions the driver at the center while offering generous space for both occupants. Strong surfaces and precise geometric forms define the layout.

Physical controls machined from anodized aluminum deliver a high level of mechanical quality, reinforced by the unmistakable **“Audi click.”** The steering wheel forms the heart of the tactile experience, featuring a classic round shape, sophisticated haptic elements, and Audi rings made from real metal.

The titanium-inspired color palette follows a tone-on-tone approach. Natural materials and indirect ambient lighting enhance the perception of solidity while creating a calm, premium atmosphere.

## Intelligent Technology, Subtly Integrated

Technology in the Audi Concept C is designed to support the driving experience without dominating it. Digital elements are always close by, yet visually restrained.

A foldable **10.4-inch center display** remains hidden until activated, preserving a clean and uncluttered interior. When deployed, it presents information intuitively and in context. Together with haptic controls on the steering wheel and center console, the operating concept delivers clarity, precision, and ease of use.
