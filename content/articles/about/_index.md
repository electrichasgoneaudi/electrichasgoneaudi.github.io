## Why?

The world needs to change its transportation to be more sustainable. Moving to electric cars is an essential part of this; for many consumers, the technology is new and scary. We hope this site can help consumers and people working with car sales understand the benefits of electric cars and contribute to a faster transition.

## Why Audi?

With more than 100 years of history, Audi has shown they can create cars with leading technology combined with a fascinating dynamic design.

Audi has committed to end the development of new internal combustion engine models by 2026, focusing solely on full-electric drivetrains, and phase out production of all petrol and diesel engines by 2033. From 2033 on, the future of the Audi brand will be fully electric. The company is continuing to pick up speed along the way. Audi wants to be a sustainable, social, and technological leader by 2030.

That’s why we love Audi and want to focus our energy and this site on all-electric Audis to help them achieve their goal. Our goal is not only to be the ultimate Audi site but the ultimate site for any car brand or model. While Audis slogan is “vorsprung durch technik” we also belive in “vorsprung durch informationen”.
