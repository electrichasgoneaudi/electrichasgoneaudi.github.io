### e-tron route planner

The route can be planned in peace and quiet via the myAudi app or directly from the car. In any case, the route along the necessary charging stations is calculated so that the goal is reached. During planning takes the function takes into account the battery charge level and the traffic situation, and shows the arrival time and estimated charging time. To keep the charging time as short as possible, charging is added to fast-charging stations as much as possible. At start-up, the route is transferred seamlessly and easily from the myAudi app to the navigation system, which takes over the guidance.

Furthermore, all targets in the car and on the smartphone are synchronized, no matter where they were originally stored. This way, you can easily and comfortably plan routes and journeys with your smartphone, and then retrieve them as navigation destinations in the car. If there are delays or traffic disruptions on one of your regular routes, messages appear in the navigation system and on the smartphone. If the original charging station can not be reached, a new route is calculated. During an active charge along the route, the remaining charging time and the current state of charge of the battery is displayed.

Early warning for increased road safety. With information from the so-called Audi swarm, you are notified of accidents, accidents, poor visibility and slippery roads. If an Audi with this technology detects a dangerous situation, it reports this to a server, which sends out a warning to all Audi drivers in cars with this service. This is how Audi drivers are notified via the station wagon and navigation system before they reach the danger point, and they thus have the opportunity to react better to dangerous situations. This can help increase safety for Audi drivers and other road users.
