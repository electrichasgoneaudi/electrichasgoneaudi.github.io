In Europe, Audi uses [Cubic Telecom](https://audi.cubictelecom.com/en/) for the built-in subscription.

For the services below, the data amount is included. The length varies between countries, but typical 3 years.

If you need data for the Wifi-zone or online radio in the car you need to buy an extra data package or use your own sim card if your model support this.
