The MEB provides the technical basis for the future compact and medium-size class models from Audi.
This platform thus provides the entry point into the electric model portfolio of the brand with
the four rings

By using the group-wide MEB platform, Audi can offer its customers affordable yet technically
sophisticated electric models with the unmistakable Audi DNA. Fascinating design, high-quality interior workmanship, and a top-of-the-line operating system. The use of maximum platform synergies in the Group makes electric mobility attractive to many new customers in
the compact segment. The modular electric drive platform of the Volkswagen Group is designed to be highly versatile and scalable to a high degree. Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.

As it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the
advantages that compact electric motors, and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.

Models from oter brands that currently use MEB are

- VW ID3
- VW ID4
- VW ID6
- Skoda Enyaq
- Cupra Born

In contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front
section is considerably shorter—the front axle and firewall move forward, making the
wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.

In terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron
concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The
architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities.

Of course, the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In
addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles,
there are also drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entry level variants.

The world premiere for [Audi Q4 e-tron](../../../models/q4-e-tron), the first Audi model based on MEB was April 14. 2021.

It comes with different setups with 2 different battery sizes and both 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive (quattro) version.

Later the [Audi Q5 e-tron](../../../models/q5-e-tron) had its world premiere. A China-only (currently) model based on MEB.
