The e-tron is based on an extensively adapted variant of the modular longitudinal platform (MLB evo).
The MLB Evo platform is a shared platform that included ICE like Lamborghini URUS and Audi A8.
But for e-tron Audi built a completely new dedicated chassis and body for e-tron so this can't be compared with other
EV like VW Golf or others that use modified ICE chassis.

Its foundation is a new body shape with numerous innovative structural elements in the lower area of the vehicle
center and the roof.

The e-tron marks Audiâ€™s start into the electric era. The SUV is the first vehicle to combine
electric mobility with Audi quality: A sophisticated drive and recuperation system, all-wheel
drive and maximum comfort. In short: Vorsprung durch Technik.

With a wheelbase length of 2,928 millimeters (115.3 in), the e-tron lies between the Q5 and
Q7 SUVs. The high-voltage battery stores up to 95 kWh of energy and forms the basis for its
range of more than 400 kilometers (248.6 mi) in the WLTP driving cycle. This is achieve
primarily by the innovative recuperation system, which can recover up to 30 percent of the
used energy during brake applications.

Audi e-tron is available both with a 2 motor setup and a 3 motor setup, making it the first EV with 3 motors.

The Audi e-tron can charge using both alternating and direct
current and is the first series-production vehicle with a charging capacity of up to 150 kW. It
owes this to its highly efficient thermal management.
