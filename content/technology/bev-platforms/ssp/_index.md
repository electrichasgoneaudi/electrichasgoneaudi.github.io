title: SSP (Scalable Systems Platform)
linktitle: SSP
description: From 2026, the Volkswagen Group will bundle its future technologies on the Scalable Systems Platform (SSP). After the Modular Electric Drive Kit (MEB) and the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), the SSP represents the next generation of all-electric, fully-digital and highly-scalable mechatronics platform.

In the future, it will be possible to build models from all brands and segments on the SSP – more than 40 million Group cars throughout its life cycle.

With the SSP, the Volkswagen Group can rapidly and efficiently provide its customers with innovative functions in their cars, across most of the brands. This makes the SSP key to autonomous driving. At the same time, considerable economies of scale are achieved, whilst also reducing complexity and development costs.

By combining different modules with various sizes of platform, the Group’s brands also have a host of opportunities to differentiate themselves. 

From 2025, Audi’s Artemis project will use significant SSP modules for the first time. In 2026, Volkswagen will introduce this technology to the high-volume segment with its first model based on the SSP – the “Trinity” project.

## Models

The first models from Audi on this platform is expected to by

- Audi A8 e-tron (2025) (Artemis project)
- Audi Q8 e-tron (2026) (Apollon project)

## Configuration

With SSP the car models can be configured in different setups to support models from VW to Porsche.

## Battery

As PPE and J1 the SSP platform will use 800 volt technology.

One of the key changes to the battery on SSP compared to other platforms is that new unified cell battery technology. VW’s unified cell technology uses the same physical pack formats, just with different chemistries inside, to make designing future EVs less expensive and requiring less time.

## Unified Software platform

With more and more integrated functionality and a higher need for integrating sensors and Autonomous driving capabilities,  Volkswagen has decided to create a new integrated software platform to be used on the different models of the different brands.

This will always be connected to receiving software updates, compared with today's platform where updates require visits to the dealer.

VW has created a new company, called Cariad which is responsible for this. Visit their [homepage](https://cariad.technology/) for more info.

See this video for detailed info about the software platforms.
