In addition, they are working on the new SSP platform that will be used on models from 2025.

Below you find details about the different platforms.

## MLB EVO

The Audi e-tron is based on an extensively adapted variant of the modular longitudinal platform (MLB evo). The MLB Evo platform is a shared platform that included ICE like Lamborghini URUS and Audi A8. But for e-tron Audi built a completely new dedicated chassis and body for e-tron

## Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB)

What the modular transversal toolkit (MQB) is for the model range with combustion engines, the modular electrification toolkit (MEB) will be for the all-electric Audi models. It is used for the smaller Audi models like Audi Q4 e-tron and Audi Q5 e-tron.

## PPE (Premium Platform Electric)

For its full-size class and luxury models, Audi is relying on a fourth platform. Audi Q6 e-tron and Audi A6 e-tron will be built on this platform

## SSP (Scalable Systems Platform)

By 2026, the Volkswagen Group will bundle its future technologies on the Scalable Systems Platform (SSP). After the Modular Electric Drive Kit (MEB) and the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), the SSP represents the next generation of all-electric, fully-digital and highly-scalable mechatronics platform.
