The central element is the 10.1-inch touch display in black panel technology. When not in use, the screen blends almost invisibly into the high-gloss black faceplate of the instrument panel. When starting the system, the user interface appears with its concise graphics. With a resolution of 1,540 x 720 pixels, the TFT screen provides pin-sharp images and high contrast, even when viewed from an angle. The large display is used for controlling navigation, media and vehicle functions. The driver can click, swipe, zoom and scroll on it. The menu structure including the search functions is intuitive and flat, like that of a modern smartphone.\nThe key strength of the MMI touch response technology is its haptic feedback. When a finger touches the display glass, it does not immediately activate a function – a gentle push with a defined pressure is required to do that. The mechanical pulse that the driver feels as confirmation feedback is created by an electromagnet that shifts the spring-mounted display very slightly sideways – by roughly the width of a human hair. At the same time a small loudspeaker emits a click sound.\nClever detailed solutions make using the new technology even more attractive. If a finger touches an icon, the software confirms either by an animation or a change in color. If the finger pushes so hard that it triggers the function, the icon or list entry lights up briefly. Similar to on a smartphone, many symbols are supported by long-touch and long-push functions. That allows the driver to reposition a tile, for instance.\nA second display on the console of the center tunnel is used to operate the air conditioning system and convenience features. The driver can save preferred functions as favorites. The display has an 8.6-inch diagonal and a screen resolution of 1,280 x 660 pixels.\nSince the driver’s wrist rests on the transmission’s gear selector knob, the display can be operated very comfortably. The driver can also enter text – either via a digital keyboard (when the vehicle is stationary) or by innovative handwriting recognition which can recognize entire words in handwriting as well as letters handwritten on top of one another. Audible feedback is given for each recognized letter, so that the driver can always keep his or her eyes focused on the road.\nThe surfaces of the two displays have a type of anti-fingerprint coating. This makes it easy to wipe off fingerprints. There is also an anti-glare layer that refracts the reflected light. This blurs the reflections so they do not distract the driver. The top layer is toughened, making it very sturdy and scratch-resistant.\nMenu overvierw The following document presents the full menu overview\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/mmi/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron MMI","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron is equipped with MMI touch.","content":"The Audi MMI® (Multi Media Interface) system was created to streamline the controls for audio, vehicle settings, and available navigation under a common interface, thereby reducing the number of buttons for a cleaner interior appearance.\nMMI Touch Audi Q4 e-tron comes with MMI Touch as standard.

The electrolyte carries the positively charged lithium ions from the Anode to the Cathode.\nThis reaction in Anode is called reduction and the anode is known as the reducing agent because it loses lithium atoms.\nThe Cathode is known as the oxidizing agent because it accepts lithium-ions from the anode.\nWhen the Anode release positive Lithium-ions, at the same time it frees electrons from the lithium atoms of the electrode.\nThese free electrons congregate inside the anode. As a result, the two electrodes have different charges:\nThe anode becomes negatively charged as electrons are released, and the cathode becomes positively charged as positive lithium-ions are consumed.\nThis difference in charge causes the electrons to want to move toward the positively charged cathode. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to get there inside the battery because the separator prevents them from doing so. The charge is measured in volt and depends on the chemistry used. A typical Lithium-ion cell has a charge between 3.6 - 4.2 volts depending on the state of charge (SOC).\nIn an EV we can take advantage of that desire for the electrons to re-unite with the positive lithium-ions in the cathode. If we create an external circuit through an electric motor or another electronic component we can the flow of electrons drive the motor.\nThe current collectors work as an electrical conductor between the electrode and external circuits.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/drivingassistance/collisionavoidanceassist/","title":"Audi e-tron GT collision avoidance assist","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT can be equipped with collision avoidance assist.

The Audi pre sense front and Audi pre sense basic safety systems as well as the lane departure warning system and cruise control system are standard features.","content":"The optional systems are subdivided into the “Tour” (PCC), “City,” and “Park” (PCV) packages, which are combined in the assist system plus. The night vision assist and surround view cameras, which offer a choice of different views, are available as additional individual options. They are also available in the “Park” package.\nThe most important system in the “Tour” assist package is adaptive cruise assist, which combines the functions of adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, and active lane assist. It can largely take over longitudinal and lateral guidance for the driver in many situations. In order to maintain the latter, the driver needs to move the steering wheel slightly at certain intervals. When the predictive efficiency assist (standard) is active, the adaptive cruise assist decelerates and accelerates the Audi e-tron GT in such a way that it consumes as little energy as possible. To do so, it evaluates information from the onboard sensors and navigation data, provided that route guidance is active. The “Tour” assist package includes further systems in addition: camera-based traffic sign recognition and the emergency assist, as well as the turn assist and collision avoidance assist, which can prevent collisions with other vehicles.\nGet out and let the car park itself: (remote) park assist plus Aside from the maneuver assist, the (remote) park assist plus, which the driver activates at the push of a button, is one of the highlights of the “Park” assist package. It detects suitable parking spaces and can maneuver the Audi e-tron GT into and out of a parallel or bay parking space at the push of a button. The driver is responsible for the maneuver. They can remain inside the car or get out beforehand – in this case, they start and supervise the parking maneuver via the myAudi app. By keeping the corresponding button pressed, the e-tron GT will roll into the space, in multiple maneuvers if necessary. Once it has reached its final position, it switches off the drive, activates the parking lock, and locks the doors. The “City” assist package includes the following safety systems: Audi pre sense rear, side assist, exit warning, intersection assist, and rear cross-traffic assist.\nAll systems use the central driver assistance controller (zFAS), which uses the sensors’ data to continuously compute an exact model of the vehicle’s environment. This way, they can react precisely and promptly to objects, such as by initiating braking. Depending on the selected options, the zFAS receives the data to do this from up to five radar sensors, five visual cameras, the thermal imaging camera for the night vision assist, and 12 ultrasound sensors.\n   System Available     360 degree cameras option (PCZ)   Active Lane assist standard (6I3)   Adaptive Cruise Assist option (PCC)   Adaptive Cruise Control with speed limiter standard   Crossing/Intersection assist Option (PCM)   Cruise control standard   Hold Assist Standard   Park Assist Option   Pre Sense Basic option   Pre Sense front standard   Pre Sense rear option (PCM)   Pre Sense side N/A   Distance warning standard   Night Vision option (9R1)   Speed limiter standard   Park assist Plus option (PCV)   Cross traffic assist rear option (PCM)   Exit warning option (PYU)   Collision avoidance assist standard   Side assist option (PCM)   Reversing camera option (KA2)   Turn assist Option   Traffic sign recognition option (PCC)    See detailed information about the systems below.\n Audi e-tron GT 360 degree cameras Audi e-tron GT can be delivered with 360 camera.

In the table below you see the total buffer for all e-electric models from Audi.\n   Model Battery Buffer Avaiable     e-tron 55/S 95 kWh 8.5kWh (9%) 86.5 kWh   e-tron 50 71 kWh 6.3kWh (8.9%) 64.7 kWh   (RS) e-tron GT 93.4 kWh 9.7kWh (10.4%%) 83.7 kWh   Q4 e-tron 40/45/50 82 kWh 5.4kWh (6.6%) 76.6 kWh   Q4 e-tron 35 55 kWh 3kWh (5.45%) 52 kWh    But many people believe this buffer protects it against charging to 100%. But in most cases, all or almost all buffer is on the bottom to protect the battery from running empty.\nSo even e-tron 55 has a relatively large buffer, charging to 100% is not good for the battery. Audi recommends not to charge more than 80% on daily basis. This is shown in the MMI and the user manual.\nThe graph below shows a generalized stress level depending on the charge level.\nBased on this the optimal is probably to keep it between 30 and 70%, but how much better it is compared to just charge to 100% is impossible to know.\nThe buffers are in reality limits on the max and minimum voltage each cell can have. Having a 4% buffer on top means the voltage on each cell is limited to a max of 96% of the max voltage.\nNumber of charge cycles The number of charge cycles affects the degradation.\nThe diagram below shows hows the battery degrade based on charging habits. Based on this, the best is to keep the charging levels around 50%.\nHigh Temperature High temperatures hurt the battery. If you live in an area with high temperatures, you should try to avoid having the car parked in the heating sun all day.\nYou can find more about degradation in our battery guide.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/comparisons/q4etron50vsetron55/","title":"Q4 e-tron 50 quattro vs e-tron 55 quattro","tags":[],"description":"Here you find a detailed comparison between Audi Q4 e-tron 50 Quattro and Audi e-tron 55.","content":"For many buyers this is a real dilemma.

This guide explains how.","content":"When the battery degrades the available battery capacity reduces. This causes a shorter range.\nIf you know how much net capacity your car should have, you can easily check it.\nThis is how you check your battery\n Charge to 100% Take a drive and at least spend 70% of the battery. Try to keep the consumption low. Take a note of your consumption and driving distance Take a note of end SOC (state of charge) (percent left on battery) Calculate actual capacity  For the following examples, we assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh net capacity from the factory.\nCalculation in miles Miles example 1 You drive 169 miles with consumption of 2.6 miles/kWh. You started the trip with 100% battery and ended up with 21%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used: 169/2.6 = 65kWh in total.\nIf you had 21% left, you have used 79%. (100%-21%)\nThe current capacity is that 79% = 65kWh.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(65/79)*100 = 82.27kWh.\n82.27 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n82.27/86.5 = 95.1%. Meaning a reduction of almost 5% from the original capacity.\nCalculation in kilometers Km example 1 If you drive 240 kilometers with a consumption of 25kWh/100 You started with 100% and ended up with 16%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used\n(280 * 25)/100 = 70kWh in total on the trip.\nIf you have 16% left you have used 84% on the trip (100-16)\n84% = 70kWh battery.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(70/84)*100 = 83.333 kWh\n83.333 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n83.33/86.5 = 96.34%. Meaning a reduction of almost 4% from the original capacity.\nWhat affects capacity Just one deviation from capacity does not necessarily mean that your battery has degraded.\nIf you have high consumption there will be some loss because of internal resistance.\nIf your battery was unbalanced it will also affect the battery capacity.\nFor the people that love to keep track of this, we recommend tracking this from the beginning of ownership. In this way you will know your car more.\nThe following example show the stats from an e-tron 55 2020v1 with 83.6kWh capacity from it was new.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/","title":"Audi e-tron GT","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT is the second all-electric model from Audi.

To reduce the dependencies to cobalt different chemistries are used.\nLithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides are the most common chemistry on EV\u0026rsquo;s today.\nThe metal ratio varies. The version was NMC 111, then NMC 622 was the common followed by NCM 711. Many vendors are working on providing cells with an 811 metal ratio.\nLithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA) Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA) are used by Panasonic.\nLithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) Lithium iron phosphate battery\nSeperator A separator is a permeable membrane placed between a battery\u0026rsquo;s anode and cathode.\nElectrolyte Liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries consist of lithium salts in an organic solvent, such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate.\nA liquid electrolyte acts as a conductive pathway for the movement of cations passing from the negative to the positive electrodes during discharge and the opposite direction when charging.\nElectrolytes based on solid materials are areas that many works on. These are called solid-state batteries. Currently, there are no concrete plans for any mass production EV with Solid-state batteries.\nCurrent collector The current collector is used to provide the conduction of electrons from inside the electrochemical reaction to the external part without any reaction within the operation window.\nCurrently used collectors are mostly made of aluminum or copper foils.\nCell Housing Cells for EV\u0026rsquo;s come in 3 different housings\nCylinder housing A cylindrical cell consists of sheet-like anodes, separators, and cathodes that are sandwiched, rolled up, and packed into a cylinder-shaped can. This is the form factor that has been used for years in the market.\nOne advantage is mechanical stability. The round shape of the battery distributes the internal pressure from side reactions over the cell circumference almost evenly. This allows the cell to tolerate a higher level of internal pressure without deformation.\nTesla is one of the few EV manufacturers that uses this.\nPrismatic housing Li-ion cells with prismatic housing consist of large sheets of anodes, cathodes, and separators sandwiched, rolled up, and pressed to fit into a hard-plastic or metallic housing in cubic form. The electrodes can also be assembled by layer stacking rather than jelly rolling.\nParts of the electrode and separator sheets of a prismatic cell that are close to the container corners can experience more stress. This can damage electrode coating and lead to the non-uniform distribution of the electrolyte.\nWhen combining prismatic cells into packs, the cell box-like shape enables optimal use of the available space. However, this optimal space is achieved at the cost of more challenging thermal management. This is because there are no space cavities between the cells as there are in a pack of cylindrical cells.\nPouch housing Pouch cells do not have a rigid enclosure like prismatic and cylinder cells and use a sealed flexible foil as the cell container.\nThis makes it the most efficient use of space and achieves a 90 to 95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs, advantages of flexible size, and safety performance. Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight but the cell needs some alternative support in the battery compartment.\nSwelling Pouch Cell Battery as a Result of Gas Generation During Charge and Discharge\nThe electrode and separator layers of a pouch cell are stacked rather than jelly-rolled. With pouch cells, the designer should allocate enough space for the cell swelling. A swelling of as much as 8% to 10% can occur after 500 cycles.\nAudi cells The below table list the cells used on the different all-electric Audi models.

The Audi e-tron GT is equipped with two permanently excited synchronous machines (PSM) that output a system performance of 530 metric hp (390 kW) and 640 Nm (472 lb-ft) of torque. While Audi RS e-tron GT output a system performance of 645 metric hp (475 kW) and 830 Nm (612.2 lb-ft) of torque.\nThe four-door Audi RS e-tron GT is propelled from zero to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 3.3 seconds and reaches 200 km/h (124.3 mph) in just over 12 seconds, before propulsion ends at 250 km/h (155.3 mph).\nIf necessary, the Audi e-tron GT can be charged in a short space of time. The high-voltage system in J1-performance platform is designed for a voltage of 800 volts and allows the battery to be charged to 80 percent in 22.5 minutes at a DC terminal with an output of 350 kW.\nIn accordance with the WLTP standard, the Audi e-tron GT achieves a range of 472 kilometers (293.5 mi) on one battery charge.\nThe battery, which has an energy content of more than 90 kWh, is located in the underbody, between the axles. The battery package is designed with recesses in the rear footwell. This provides a high level of seating comfort for all occupants. This special layout allows the drive battery to be integrated in the vehicle floor despite the low body position that is typical for sports cars, thereby creating a very low vehicle center of gravity. At the same time, this creates comfortable seating ergonomics.\nIts lightweight design body and the optional roof made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) are built according to the principle of multi-material construction. At 4.989 meters (16.3 ft) long, 1.96 meters (6.4 ft) wide and 1.41 meters (4.5 ft) tall, the Audi e-tron GT has the proportions of a typical Gran Turismo.\nIn combination with the low center of gravity, the quattro drive, which is equipped with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, offers ideal conditions for a sports car.\nThe drive management distributes the torques of the electric motors between the axles as needed and also regulates the wheels separately.\nThe technology layout on J1-performance platform allows for numerous suspension and performance features, for example all-wheel steering or a sport differential, providing excellent traction and a high level of vehicle dynamics.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/uiandoperations/navigation/","title":"Audi e-tron GT navigation system","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has an standard navigation system.

That is the reason they call it \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;\nAudi has not made it possible to enable one pedal driving permanent. It is a little different on the different models but the principle Audi follows are the same.\nThey rather want their drivers to maximize the efficiency with coasting instead of automatic reducing speed when you lift the foot of the gas pedal.\nOne pedal driving is less efficient since you lose energy compared to coasting.\nThis is because you only get approx 80% of the kinetic energy the moving car has, back to the battery, when doing recuperation. (Assuming the traffic and road allow to coast)\nYou are also forced to have the foot on the pedal at a specific position to freeroll/coast to find the position when no energy is going out of the battery and nothing is going in.\nAudi e-tron On Audi e-tron can set recuperation to manual (MMI -\u0026gt; Vehicle -\u0026gt; Efficiency Assistant -\u0026gt; Recuperation) and then you can every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddles, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot of the \u0026ldquo;gas pedal\u0026rdquo; and works as \u0026ldquo;one-pedal-driving\u0026rdquo;.\nWith the wheel paddles, you can set the recuperation to 3 different levels. (for more or less braking). High, medium and off.\nThis is not recommended for experienced drivers. If you learn to coast you will get the best comfort and the best range. Next time it will be reset back. For drivers coming from other EV\u0026rsquo;s, this might be the way to unlearn the bad habit.\nIf you set it recuperation to automatic it will only recuperate when you are getting close to other cars or you are close to an intersection or other reasons you need to slow down. Otherwise, it will coast and save the maximum amount of energy as long you don\u0026rsquo;t press the accelerator.\nAudi Q4 e-tron On Audi Q4 e-tron you can set the car in B-mode with help of the shifter. In B-mode the car will regenerate when lifting the watt pedal.\nDriving in D-mode and using the brake pedals that automaticly gives regen gives the best effiency. Coast whenever you can.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/exterior/optics/","title":"Audi e-tron optics","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron can be deliverd with standard or black optics package.

Where cells are grouped into modules that again are grouped into a battery system.\nIn the future, we will see cars with Cell2Pack technologies where cells are put directly into packs and even Cell2Car technology where cells are put directly into the car. More about that later\nTypical a battery pack consists of modules that consist of several cells.\nModules Modules are a combination of cells. The number of cells in a module varies.\nArchitecture The cells inside a module can be connected in different ways.\n Serial connecting gives a higher voltage Parallel connection gives a higher capacity.  Example 1 Below you see how modules on the Audi e-tron 55 are. There are 12 cells per module. They are grouped into 3 groups where 4 cells are connected in parallel. Then those groups are connected in serial giving it a 3 serial 4 parallel configuration (3s4p).

The problem with today\u0026rsquo;s approach with Cell2Modules is that the energy density on the battery system is much lower than on the cell level. This is because of all the structural elements in a battery that does not add any energy content to a battery pack.\nTo reduce this problem Volkswagen is moving to a Cell2Pack technology where Audi with its Artemis project will launch the first car in late 2024.\nThe technology is based on putting the cells directly in to the pack increasing the energy density to the battery system. This reduces weight and increases capacity.\nOn March 15. 2021 the Volkswagen group that Audi is part of, presented their strategy as part of Power day.\nSee the complete presentation.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/buttons/","title":"Audi e-tron button styles","tags":[],"description":"You can order the e-tron with different button styles","content":"Buttons in black glas finish To get a nicer look, you can order control keys in a black glass finish.\nControl keys and light keys in black glass finish.

The information provided by some of the assist systems and the turning arrows of the navigation system as well as its starting points and destinations are visually superimposed in the corresponding place on the real-life outside world as content of the AR section and displayed dynamically. They appear to be floating at a distance of roughly ten meters from the driver. Depending on the situation, they can appear considerably further ahead in some cases. The driver can understand the displays very quickly without being confused or distracted by them, and they are extremely helpful in poor visibility conditions.\nThe field of view for the AR content from the driver’s perspective is equivalent to a diagonal of around 70 inches. Below it is a flat near-field area window, known as the status section. It displays the speed driven and the traffic signs as well as the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. It appears to hover about three meters in front of the driver.\nThe heart of the system: the picture generation unit The technical heart of the augmented reality head-up display is the picture generation unit (PGU), which is located deep inside the long instrument panel. A particularly bright LCD directs the light beams it generates onto two level mirrors, and special optical components separate the portions for the near-field and distant areas. The level mirrors direct the beams onto a large concave mirror that can be adjusted electrically. From there, they reach the windshield, which reflects them into what is known as the eyebox and thus onto the driver’s eyes. At an apparent distance of ten meters, or even further away depending on the situation, the driver sees the symbols just as clearly as their real-life environment.\nPredictive picture generator: the AR Creator What is known as the AR Creator serves as the mastermind and picture generator on the software side – this is a processing unit in the modular infotainment platform (MIB 3) that is comprised of multiple individual modules. The AR Creator renders the display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapts them to the geometry of the projection optics. At the same time, it calculates their location in relation to the environment, on which it obtains information via the raw data of the front camera, the radar sensor, and the GPS navigation. Its software consists of roughly 600,000 lines of programming code, around 50 percent more than the entire control system of the first version of the Space Shuttle.\nWhile performing its computing work, the AR Creator takes into account that there are always a few fractions of a second between the identification of an object by the sensors and the output of the graphic content. During these brief time windows, the Q4 e-tron can change its position considerably, whether due to braking or a pothole. Multiple computations are performed continuously to ensure that the display in the eyebox does not jump into the wrong position. One of them takes place in the camera software. For another, the AR Creator uses the most recent data to make a predictive calculation of the car’s continued forward movement. In a further computation, it estimates the vertical movement on the basis of data supplied by the camera, the radar, and the sensors of the stabilization control (ESC). These insights are incorporated into the “shake compensation,” which takes place a few milliseconds before the picture is output and whose task is to prevent any disruptive shaking of the display.\nNavigation: the drone flies ahead The augmented reality head-up display demonstrates its strengths in a particularly impressive way during navigation. On the road, what is known as the drone – a floating arrow – shows the next point of action on the route. It is dynamic: When approaching an intersection, for example, the floating arrow first announces the turning maneuver before an animated arrow steers the driver onto the road with precision. If the route then continues straight ahead, the drone flies ahead and disappears in order to then reappear with sufficient time before the next point of action. The distance to the turning point is displayed in meters in the lower window of the near-field area.\nEven if the driver has activated the adaptive cruise assist, which keeps the car in the center of the lane, the augmented reality head-up display assists them with visual hints. As soon as the Q4 e-tron approaches a lane marking without the turn signal having been activated, the lane departure warning superimposes the real-life lane marking with a red line. Another example is regulation in relation to a vehicle driving in front: If it is active, the car is marked on the display with a colored stripe – this allows the driver to understand the status of the adaptive cruise assist or adaptive cruise control without being distracted. A red marking and a warning symbol appear if the adaptive cruise assist prompts the driver to verify that they are paying attention.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/headliner/","title":"Headliner design","tags":[],"description":"You can order the e-tron GT with two different interior headliner colors","content":" "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/headliner/","title":"Audi e-tron headliner design","tags":[],"description":"You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors","content":"Standard moon silver Black rooflining You can order Audi e-tron with black headliner .

Their continuous high beams can shine with maximum brightness without blinding other road users. Option ID 8G4\nMatrix LED with Laser Topping the range are the matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light. In the center of the headlights, between the low beam and high beam modules, there is a laser spot that is activated from a speed of 70 km/h (43.5 mph) and doubles the range of the high beam. It is framed by an X-shaped trim with expressive design that is a small work of art in itself.

Independently of the headlight configuration, the rear lights are fitted entirely with LEDs and dynamic turn signals that spreads out flat under the tail light signature. The brake light is located below, in a low and dark area.\nComing home and leaving home animation: character made visible The top-of-the-line headlights offer another characteristic feature: coming home and leaving home animations at the front and rear. The leaving home sequence, which is activated when the doors are unlocked, is inspired by the power of a sound wave: The illumination of the individual elements builds up quickly and strongly, then retreats briefly before going all in the second time. With the RS model, the animations are even more dynamic.\nThis animation shows the lighting technology including Matrix LED headlights with laser as additional high beam in the Audi e-tron GT.

With a color temperature of around 5,500 Kelvin, their light resembles daylight and hardly causes any eye fatigue – especially in the dark and in the case of adverse weather conditions. In addition, LED headlights offer longer visual range than xenon headlights. In fog and precipitation, they cause the driver less glare. The LEDs are maintenance-free and designed to last the life of the car. The give the Audi models a distinctive look and strong accents with their innovative daytime and nighttime designs.\nDepending on the model the LED headlights are designed differently. In the Audi A5, for example, 26 LEDs per headlight generate all lighting functions. In each headlight, 14 LEDs work together to generate the low and high beam lights, and they are supplemented by a module for the all-weather and turning lights. A light conductor along the upper border of the headlight generates the daytime running lights, parking lights and turn signal lights. Special illumination functions are available for intersections, country roads, expressways and poor weather – and their interplay with the navigation system makes their range of performance even greater.\nHD Matrix LED headlights Matrix LED headlights produce the high beam with tiny light-emitting diodes that are bundled in common reflectors or lenses, depending on the model. With their intelligent function, they illuminate the road superbly without blinding other road users.\nWhen the light switch is set to Automatic and the high beams are on, the system is switched on outside of urban areas at speeds of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) and above. As soon as the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles or city limits, the controller switches off individual LEDs or dims them in 64 stages, creating several million possible light patterns. The Matrix LED light masks out other vehicles while continuing to fully illuminate the zones between and adjacent to them.\nThe LEDs in the Matrix LED headlights also assume the function of cornering lights, shifting the focal point of the light along the curve. This occurs shortly before the wheel is turned, based on predictive route data provided by MMI navigation plus.\nAudi introduced the next development stage of this technology, the HD Matrix LED high beam, in the A8 (D5). Each headlight integrates 32 small, individually controllable light-emitting diodes. They are arranged in two rows in a common housing. Thanks to the new configuration and to a low beam that is also variable, the HD Matrix LED headlights illuminate the road particularly dynamically and precisely.\nHD Matrix LED lights is installed on all e-trons, but you need to buy an option to active it. The optionId is PX6\nIf you dont buy this option when ordering the car you can also buy it as function on demand from the myAudi app. Note it requires two packages to get the full matrix experience as described above. The HD Matrix and Light Function package.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\n  Digital matrix LED headlights With the digital matrix LED headlights as top-of-the range equipment, Audi presents a worldwide first in a production vehicle: Broken down into minute pixels, their light can illuminate the road in high resolution. The design is based on a technology abbreviated as DMD (digital micromirror device) and is also used in many video projectors. At its heart is a small chip containing one million micromirrors, each of whose edge length measures just a few hundredths of a millimeter. With the help of electrostatic fields, each individual micromirror can be tilted up to 5,000 times per second. Depending on the setting, the LED light is either directed via the lenses onto the road or is absorbed in order to mask out areas of the light beam.\nIn the Audi e-tron Sportback, the digital light that will expand the offering in mid-2020, performs multiple tasks. It can generate dynamic leaving- and coming-home animations that appear as projections on a wall or on the ground. This presentation transforms the area in front of the car into a carefully illuminated stage. Not only does the digital light system deliver cornering, city, and highway lighting as versions of the low-beam light with exceptional precision, it also supplements the high-beam light by masking out other road users with even greater accuracy. Above all, however, it offers innovative functions such as lane light and orientation light. On freeways, the lane light creates a carpet of light that illuminates the driver’s own lane brightly and adjusts dynamically when he or she changes lane. In this way, it improves the driver’s awareness of the relevant lane and contributes to improved road safety. In addition, the orientation light uses darkened areas masked out from the light beam to predictively show the vehicle’s position in the lane, thereby supporting—especially on narrow roads or in highway construction zones—the safe lane centering assist. The marking light function is also used in conjunction with the optional night vision assist. The light automatically draws attention to any pedestrians it detects, thereby reducing the danger of overlooking pedestrians in the immediate vicinity of the lane.\nThe optionID is PXC for Digital matrix LED Headlights.\n Entry Lights You can order e-tron entry lights option id 9TF\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/technology/lights/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron light technology","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has advanced lightning options","content":"The headlights There is two types of headlights available on Audi Q4 e-tron\nStandard headlights The headlights of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron are fully equipped with LEDs as standard.\nThe standard headlights does not include high-beam assistant or head light washers.\nHigh beam assistant has option id 8G1 and head light washers has option id 8X8\nMatrix Headlights On request, Audi also offers the Matrix LED headlights – they lend the two electric compact SUVs a look that is full of character and unmistakable, day and night.

Above and below it are a total of nine flat daytime running light segments, which, together with the large vertical anchor segment at the outer edge, can be configured into four digital light signatures. Two slat trims made of brushed stainless steel divide the digital daytime running light segments into 49 small sections. Seen from the side, they appear to be well shielded, lying one on top of the other like the slats of vertical blinds; the full power of the individual light segments is easily visible from the front – creating a fascinating effect that plays with light and shadows.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\n  Striking taillight signature: the light strip at the rear In combination with the Matrix LED headlights, there is also a particularly elegant light solution at the rear of the compact electric SUV. A light strip runs across its full width; at its center the taillight beams out in a fine line that splits into separate segments at its ends. Each individual segment is modeled as a three-dimensional body, resulting in a light sculpture that is expressive from all perspectives. The light signature opens up into a large light anchor segment on the sides of the vehicle. Its dynamic graphic is inspired by intricate electric circuits and bears the Four Rings radiating in signature red as the central detail. The dynamic turn signals add a further highlight in the reversing lights.\nWhen the car is unlocked and exited, dynamic “leaving home” and “coming home” light sequences are played in the rear lights and the headlights. The sequences in the headlights vary depending on which daytime running light signature is selected.\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/technology/bev-platforms/meb/","title":"Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB)","tags":[],"description":"What the modular transversal toolkit (MQB) is for the model range with combustion engines, the modular electrification toolkit (MEB) will be for the all-electric Audi models.","content":"The MEB provides the technical basis for the future compact and medium-size class models from Audi. This platform thus provides the entry point into the electric model portfolio of the brand with the four rings\nBy using the group-wide MEB platform, Audi can offer its customers affordable yet technically sophisticated electric models with the unmistakable Audi DNA. Fascinating design, high-quality interior workmanship, and a top-of-the-line operating system. The use of maximum platform synergies in the Group makes electric mobility attractive to many new customers in the compact segment. The modular electric drive platform of the Volkswagen Group is designed to be highly versatile and scalable to a high degree. Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.\nAs it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the advantages that compact electric motors, and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.\nModels from oter brands that currently use MEB are\n VW ID3 VW ID4 VW ID6 Skoda Enyaq Cupra Born  In contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front section is considerably shorter—the front axle and firewall move forward, making the wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.\nIn terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities.\nOf course, the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, there are also drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entry level variants.\nThe world premiere for Audi Q4 e-tron, the first Audi model based on MEB was April 14. 2021.\nIt comes with different setups with 2 different battery sizes and both 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive (quattro) version.\nLater the Audi Q5 e-tron had its world premiere.

In this article, we will try to show how much regeneration can affect consumption.","content":"We will first explain the concept and then give you some scenarios to show how much is regenerated.\nWe will then go into physics and explain the math behind the scenarios for those who want to understand the details.\nIn the end, we discuss if regeneration of energy is always the best option.\nHow does it work? The regeneration happens when the electric motors are used as generators to reduce the speed of a moving vehicle.\nFor quattro models, like the Audi e-tron, both engines can be used for regenerative braking depending on the scenario.\nFor coasting and light braking, only the rear motor is used, but when cornering or hard braking both motors are used.\nThe brakes also blend in the physical brakes if needed mixing it with the regenerative brakes seamlessly.\n  Coasting regeneration  The below video shows in detail how the different engines are used.\n  How much can be regenerated? The following scenarios use math and physics to explain how large the benefits of regenerative braking are.\nThe details behind the calculation are explained in the physics chapter, but you should know that a moving object has kinetic energy that can be regenerated and a car located in an elevated position has potential energy that can be regenerated.\nIn addition, there is aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance that are forces that works against the movement of the car.\nThe drivetrain is also not without loss, which means that some energy is lost in the conversion of energy. Either from power on the battery to movement of the car, or vice versa, from movement on the car to power on the battery. On the Audi e-tron, this efficiency is about 80%.\nScenario 1: Pikes Peak Let\u0026rsquo;s take Pikes Peak as an example. This mountain is 14.110 ft (4300 meters) high but if you drive down the first 18.6 miles you have dropped 6538 ft (1993 meters)\n1993 meters for an Audi e-tron 55 at 2900kg is 15.74kWh in potential energy.\n  Driving down Pikes Peak in Audi e-tron  18.6 miles is 30 km. The speed down is low and based on rolling resistance and speed at 40km/h have an energy consumption of 10.52kWh/100km.\nFor 30km /18.6miles this means 3.15 kWh in total. This energy will be taken from the potential energy.\nThis means 12.59kWh to regenerate. With 80% efficiency, this would mean 10.07kWh back into the battery.\nIn the video below you see a real-world test of just exactly this trip and how much they are able to regenerate.\n  Scenario 2: Fully stop from 75mph In this scenario, the car is moving at 75mph (120.7km/h) and needs to make a full stop for a red light.\nAs shown in the graph below 75mph for a 2900kg Audi e-tron gives the total kinetic energy of 0,472626718 kWh.\nWith 80% drivetrain efficiency, this means the car will be able to get 0.38kWh back to the battery.\nA full trip on 100km (62 miles) with 10 full stops like this would then save 3.8kWh for the total trip compared with a car with only friction brakes.\nThis means a consumption reduction of 3.8kWh/100km.\nScenario 3: Reduce speed from 30 mph to fully stop This scenario is a typical city driving scenario. When driving at 30 mph (48.28km/h) the Audi e-tron has a total kinetic energy of 0,075620275kWh.\nBased on the 80% efficiency of the drivetrain this saves 0,06059kWh back to the battery.\nIf you drive 100km in city traffic and need to make 100 stops like this, you save 6,05 kWh energy.\nThis reduces energy consumption by 6.05kWh/100km compared to a car with only friction brakes\nScenario 4: Driving down from Saltfjellet mountain This mountain is located in Northern Norway and the main road from South to North passes over it (E6).\nIf we take this section of the road where it starts to go downhill we see that the start is at 650 meters (2132feet) and it ends at 125 meters (410 feet) above sea level. With a distance of 16.4 km (10.2 miles), this gives a decline of 3.1%\nThis means potential energy of 4.147 kWh.\nThe speed limit is 80km/h (49.7mph) and based on standard consumption on a dry road, this would mean that this car requires 2.49kWh to roll this distance driven by the potential energy.\nThe rest could be regenerated, and with 80% efficiency, this gives 1.3kWh back in the battery.\n1.3kWh should give 6.8km additional range in 80km/h (49.7mph)\nUnderstanding the physics Kinetic energy A moving object has kinetic energy. This energy depends on the weight of the object and the speed of the object.\nThe formula is\nWhere\n KE = kinetic energy in Joule m = mass of a body v = velocity of a body in meters/second  In addition, 1 Joule is 2.778·10⁻⁴ Wh\nIn all calculations on this page, we use the Audi e-tron 55 with a weight of 2900kg in the examples (car + driver). The below table shows how much kinetic energy this car will have in common speeds-\n   Speed km/h mph m/s Kinetic energy     50 kmh 31.07 mph 13.89 m/s 0,077696331 kWh   80 km/h 49,7 mph 22.222 m/s 0.1989 kWh   104.7km/h 65 mph 29.0575 m/s 0.340083 kWh   120.7km/h 75 mph 33.528 m/s 0.452773 kWh    You can use this kinetic energy calculator for other speeds. See also the graph below.\nRotational kinetic energy In addition to the kinetic energy of the car itself, the wheels spinning on the car also contain rotational kinetic energy that can be regenerated.\nThe formula for rotational energy\n E: the rotational kinetic energy, expressed in Joules. I: the moment of inertia of the object, expressed in kg*m². ω: the angular velocity of the body, expressed in radians per second  For a wheel moment of inertia can be calculated\nI = M * R²\nFor an Audi e-tron, we do the calculation for the wheel option 265/40 R22. With an estimated weight of 30 kg per wheel and a radius of 38.54 cm you get\nI = 30 * 0.3854^2 = 4,4559948\nFor 80km/h the wheel will spin with 566.89 rpm and the resulting kinetic energy would be 8.724333 Wh or 0,008724333 kWh for 4 wheels.\nNote: This is not 100% correct since the formula is based on a wheel with the same form from center to edge. But it is close enough for this kind of calculation.\nIf you want to calculate you can try the Rotational Kinetic Energy calculator\nGravitational/Potential energy Potential energy exists when the car is located at an elevated location compared to the destination.\nThe formula is quite simple.\n U: gravitational energy in joule m: mass in kg g: gravitational field 9.8 m/s^2 on surface h: height in meters  For example, the Audi e-tron 55 on 2900kg located at 1000 meters (3280 feet) above sea level will have the potential energy of 7.8998 kWh (28.492.85 Joule)\nIn areas with elevation, the potential energy will be the biggest source of regenerated energy.\nSee potential energy calculator\nSummary The below graph shows the total kinetic energy and the two types of kinetic energy.\n  Graph over kinetic energy  Understanding energy consumption Before we give you an example of how much energy can be regenerated, we need to explain energy consumption. Because this affects the result.\nConsumption by aerodynamic drag A moving car will have forces based on air resistance that will push against the movement.\n  Audi e-tron in wind tunnel  The formula for drag is:\n P: Air density (1.225 on the ground at 15 °C) u: Speed in meters/second A: Frontal area of the car (2.65m2 on Audi e-tron) CD: 0.28 on Audi e-tron 55  Based on this as an example. 80km/h requires power on 4.9kW (6.23kWh/100km) to overcome aerodynamic drag\nNote that the power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity, so an Audi e-tron 55 traveling at 160km/h requires 39,89 kW (24,94 kWh/100km) to overcome drag.\nTemperature affects density. At -25 the density is 1.4224 and the consumption at 80 km/h increases to 7.23kWh/100km.\nFor all calculations on this article, we assume 15 °C\nRolling resistance In addition to drag force, there is rolling resistance from wheels and other drivetrain components that works against movement.\nIt is not easy to find this number, but with knowing the total consumption and the consumption caused by drag, and the efficiency on the drivetrain it is possible to estimate the rolling resistance on the Audi e-tron.\nBased on driver history it seems like driving on a dry road at 80 km/h in summer temperature requires around 19kWh/100km energy from the battery. If we assume 80% efficiency in the drivetrain, we have an energy need of 15.2kWh/100km in total including drag.\nIf we take away the energy needed for drag, we have around 8.95kWh/100km to overcome rolling resistance.\nThis number is an estimate. On wet roads or roads with snow, the rolling resistance increases.\nConsumption summary The below diagram shows the calculated consumption needed to overcome drag and rolling resistance and consumption from the battery based on 80% efficiency of the drivetrain. The real efficiency is not known but it is expected to be around 80%.\n  Calculated consumption  See also full table with kinetic energy and consumption for all speeds from 1-100 mph (1-161 km/h)\nIs regen the best option always? Since regenerative braking is only 80% efficient it is best to avoid using it when you can. For scenario 1, driving down Pikes Peak is impossible without regenerative braking. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use regen you will crash. But if you assume flat road on scenarios 2 and 3, you would do better if you look ahead and let the car coast, so it uses the rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag to reduce the speed.\nThis would mean you need to lift your foot from the watt pedal early enough so you stop at the point you want by itself.\nSo how much energy would that save? Two factors reduce total consumption.\n You will not lose 20% of the kinetic energy when regening You will not lose 20% of the energy trying to keep the speed  Theoretical this can save\n Scenario 2: 1.89 kWh/100km Scenario 3: 3.02 kWh/100km  But this is in the best-case scenario where you can calculate exactly where to lift the foot of the watt pedal. In the real world, this benefit would be smaller since you would end up needing to add some power or braking at the end when you are not able to calculate this correctly.\nCan you see in the car how much was regenerated? A common misunderstanding is that you can look at the range reported in the car to see how much was regenerated.\nThe range meter bases its calculation on the last 100km driven. If we take scenario 4 and assume the car has been driven from sea level up to the top at 650 meters in 80km/h (49.7 mph) the consumption would be 25.4kWh/100km at 650 meters.\nOn the Audi e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery capacity, the range would be calculated to 340km (211 miles) for a full battery based on this consumption.\nAfter driving down the road section scenario 4 the total consumption from the battery would be reduced from 25.4kWh/100km to 21kWh/100km.\nThis would increase the calculated range to 411km (255 miles) for a charged 100% battery (less depending on the real SOC). Based on this you could mistakenly believe that you have regenerated 71km (44 miles), but the correct is 6.8km.(4.2 miles)\nThis type of increase you could even see in scenarios where there is no regeneration, but just a decline that reduced the consumption.\nThe only way to know how much you have regenerated is to look at how much the state of charge of the battery changes from top to bottom of the mountain.\nOne pedal driving vs manual/automatic regen On electric Audis, you can use regenerative brakes in different ways\n Manual, only using the brake pedal Automatic, letting the car decide when to regenerate Manual, using steering wheel paddles to regenerate One pedal driving - automatic regenerate when lifting the foot off watt pedal  All methods use the same electric drivetrain components to do braking, so they have the same efficiency.\nBut one-pedal-driving has a little reduced efficiency in scenarios where the driver wants to transition from using power to coasting.\nSince you would need to keep your foot on the pedal at a specific position to not use any energy or braking you will always spend more time coming to this position compared to lifting the foot directly off the pedal. In addition, it takes some training to keep the foot in perfect position.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Audi recommends using automatic regen with coasting to save energy.\nThe difference is small, probably less than 10% of the difference between coasting and regenerative braking in the scenarios where coasting is possible.\nFor scenarios like scenario 1, there is no difference since you will do regenerative braking to keep the car on the road.\nSince the difference is so small, you should choose based on your personal preference.\nYou can read more about one-pedal-driving\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/s-line/","title":"S-line exterior package","tags":[],"description":"The S-line exterior package contains additional styling elements.","content":"The more distinctively contoured bumper is flanked by more expressive air curtains painted in silver.\nIn addition, the Single frame grill has a shadow look compared with the standard that has a silver look.\nThe rear diffusor have a more sporty and dynamic look.\nElements on the door is in silver compared to standard that has body color or contrast color for standard.

In this guide, we explain what affects the range of your all-electric Audi and why you don&#39;t see the range as expected.","content":"The range of electric cars is typically given as a WLTP range (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) in Europe or EPA in the US.\nBelow you see the range of the different current and some future Audi models. The range is from 341km (211 miles) to 700km (435 miles) according to the WLTP combined standard.\nThe most important aspect of range is of course how large the battery is. A larger battery means more energy to use.\nThe below chart shows the available battery size for the different models.\nBut the battery is not the only factor in the stated range. Another important factor is how efficient the car is.\nAnd with efficiency, it means how much energy is used from the battery for a given distance. In Europe, it is typical stated as kWh/100km meaning how many kWh is needed to drive 100km. In the US and the UK, it is rated as miles per kWh, meaning how far can you go with 1 kWh.\nThe below diagram shows the calculated consumption in kWh/100km for the different all-electric models is according to WLTP combined rating.\nWhat affects the WLTP consumption? The efficiency or WLTP consumption is affected by many attributes of the car.\nAerodynamic drag The aerodynamic drag affects how much energy is needed to move. The shape of the body affects it but also the design of the wheels.\nAudi A6 e-tron concept is currently the model with the lowest drag coefficient with a Cw value on only 0.22\nIn the below graph you see how much consumption the aerodynamic drag causes for the different model series for Audi.\n  Forbruk grunnet luftmotstand  Beregnede verdier for forbruk som kun kommer fra aerodynamisk luftmotstand basert på 80 % drivverkseffektivitet.\n   Speed Audi e-tron 55 Audi Q4 e-tron Audi e-tron GT     50km/h (31mph) 3.04kWh/100km 2.94 kWh/100km 2.31kWh/100km   80km/h (49.7mph) 7.79 kWh/100km 7.52 kWh/100km 5.92kWh/100km   120km/h (74.6mph) 17.53kWh/100km 16.94kWh/100km 13.33kWh/100km    Du ser hvordan Audi e-tron GT i høy hastighet sparer mye energi sammenlignet med suven på grunn av mindre aerodynamisk luftmotstand.\nDisse verdiene er basert på luftmotstandskoeffisienten og størrelsen på frontområdet til modellene\n   Model Drag coefficient (cd) Frontal area     Audi e-tron SUV 0.28 2.65m2   Audi e-tron Sportback 0.26 2.65m2   Audi Q4 e-tron SUV 0.28 2.56m2   Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback 0.26 2.56m2   Audi e-tron GT 0.24 2.35m2   Audi A6 e-tron sportback 0.22 ?m2   Audi A6 Avant e-tron sportback 0.24 ?m2    Rolling resistance The rolling resistance sometimes called rolling friction or rolling drag is the force resisting the motion when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface.\nThis is affected by the width of the tires, the weight of the car, the tire compound, and the tire pressure.\nAudi RS e-tron GT has very wide tires with 285mm to get the best traction. This increases rolling resistance. As an option, you can get 305mm wide tires that increase traction and decreases range.\nSome tire producers have started producing specific tires for EV with low rolling resistance that affect range.\nAudi delivers these types of tires on some of the models. See below for a very good and detailed test that describes the difference between EV optimized tires and regular.\n  Weight A heavier car requires more energy to move.\nThe efficiency of the drivetrain/motors Electric motors are very efficient by default, but there are still some different technologies that give different consumption based on the setup.\nPermanently excited synchronous use less energy in use but have higher coasting resistance. Induction motors use a little more energy to move but have almost zero coasting resistance.\nNewer cars often combine these two techniques having a rear synchronous motor always in use and an induction motor in front. Example Audi Q4 e-tron quattro 50.\nAudi is working on the new PPE platform and already now we know that this drivetrain will have a improved effiency\nThe internal resistance of the battery The internal resistance in the battery causes heat loss in the battery.\nFactors vary based on selected options Many of the above factors are fixed. Like the e-tron Sportback has less drag than the e-tron SUV because of the body shape.\nBut other factors are affected by the equipment you add to your car. If you buy wider tires, you will get a higher consumption and then a shorter range.\nThe below diagram shows hows adding the max options of the car increase the WLTP consumption.\nFrom the diagram, you can see that an Audi e-tron 55 has a consumption of 19.61 kWh/100km in the basic trim, but 23.44 kWh/100km in the top trim. Reducing the range from 441km (274 miles) to 369km (229 miles).\nWhat affects the real-world consumption In the real world, it is almost impossible to get the same range as given by WLTP or EPA. This is because that range is based on ideal driving conditions with specific behavior.\nRoad condition Road conditions are one of the factors that affect consumption. If it is dry tarmac the rolling resistance is much lower than if the road is wet or is packed with snow.\nThe speed High speed increases the consumption because of higher drag.\nThe temperature The temperature affects the range in different ways. If it is cold the air is denser and it is a higher aerodynamical drag.\nIn addition, warm and cold weather could increase the consumption of air condition system in the car.\nThe driving style You as a driver can improve range a lot.\n Look ahead and coast as much as possible When needing to reduce speed, start reducing when possible so early that you only use recuperation.  How does the range indicator work on electric Audi The range indicator on all-electric Audis is much more advanced than many other brands.\nWhile some brands show the same range no matter what and ignore the driving condition or the driving style to the owner, all-electric Audis tries to learn from previous trips and this causes a lot of questions about range from owners since range varies and drops when driving condition worsens.\nBelow you see some typical questions.\nSo how does the range indicator works?\nThe range indicator base its range on the following data\n Average consumption on the last 100km driven The state of charge (of much is the battery charged) The planned route in the navigation system  So assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery and you have charged it to 100%.\nIf your average consumption was 25kWh/100 on the previous trips, the range indicator, or GOM (guessometer) that many calls it would calculate you would have a range on 346km. If your average consumption was 20kWh/100km it would calculate 432km. And if you are one that likes speed and had an average of 30kWh/100 km your calculated range would be 288km.\nBut this is the best guess based on previous trips. If you change behavior on the next trip, the range calculated would be wrong.\nIf you have done many short trips in cold weather, you would have spent lots of energy to heat up the car. But this average consumption is not relevant if you the next day are taking a long drive. The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/virtualcockpit/","title":"Audi e-tron virtual Cockpit","tags":[],"description":"The Audi virtual cockpit is a fully digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch TFT screen.","content":"The virtual cockpit display has a full HD resolution of 1,920 x 720 pixels.

Porsche will use it for their upcoming Porsche Macan, while Audi will use it for Audi Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron, and others.\nWith its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury-class segments.\nPPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.\nAudi is developing various model series based on PPE that will cover the segments from the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers with various different vehicle types.\nIn doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.\nThe diagram below show hows PPE models will be compared to J1 and MEB models in various aspects.\n  PPE models compared with J1 and MEB models  Battery Like in the Audi e-tron GT, the battery will be 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a high charging capacity of up to 270 kW.\nAll-electric models based on PPE will be delivered with different battery sizes over time. Audi A6 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron will be delivered with two different configurations when they are launched.\n 12 modules with 100 kWh gross (94kWh net) 10 modules with 83.3kWh gross (78kWh net).  The cells will be prismatic and each module is expected to have 34 cells on 67AH.\nThis gives the following battery architecture.\n 204s2p and 737Volt nominal for the 12 module version 170s2p and 614Volt nominal for the 10 module version  More battery sizes will come at a later time. For the Audi grandshpere concept Audi uses a PPE platform with 120kWh battery.\nMotors and performance The technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive automatically when needed.\nIt will of course also be possible to realize different performance levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform. Models based on PPE will be delivered with different motor setups in combination with the small and large batteries.\nThe models will have from around 300HP to close to 700HP depending on setup.\nAdvanced technology The dimensions and overhangs of the low-floor Audi models on the PPE platform will be slightly shorter than those of the current combustion engine models on MLB basis but will offer greater interior length. As is typical for electric models, there are no transmission or center tunnels. As traditional premium vehicles, the PPE models can be equipped with numerous high-end technologies: In the drive area, torque control takes place via torque vectoring, while the typical Audi features of air suspension or all-wheel steering are provided in the suspension area.\n  Models expected to be on the PPE platform  Audi Q6 e-tron Confirmed Audi SQ6 e-tron UnConfirmed Audi A6 e-tron Confirmed Audi S6 e-tron UnConfirmed Audi RS6 e-tron UnConfirmed Audi A4 e-tron Unconfirmed  Audi and Porsche will reuse most parts between the models\n  Reuse of parts of different PPE models  The below video show Audi A6 Avant concept with more details about PPE\n  PPE vs MLB evo In 2020 Audi had a presentation where they discussed some of the improvements of the new platform over the MLB evo platform.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/uiandoperations/smartphoneinterface/","title":"Audi e-tron GT smartphone Interface","tags":[],"description":"With the Smartphone Interface option you expand your smartphone in to the MMI system","content":"With Audi smartphone interface with option id IU1 you get the possibility to use Apple Carplay or Android Auto in your MMI system.\nThis gives you access to many usefull apps like Spotify and Waze directly in MMI.\nThe below image show how Waze warns users about a speed camera.\nAndroid Auto requires you to use cable, but Apple Carplay is supported throug cable and wireless.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/smartphoneinterface/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron smartphone Interface","tags":[],"description":"With the Smartphone Interface option on Audi Q4 e-tron you expand your smartphone in to the MMI system","content":"With Audi smartphone interface with option id IU1 you get the possibility to use Apple Carplay or Android Auto in your MMI system.\nThis gives you access to many usefull apps like Spotify and Waze directly in MMI.\nThe below image show how Waze warns users about a speed camera in a Audi e-tron.\nAndroid Auto requires you to use cable, but Apple Carplay is supported throug cable and wireless.\nCurrently this option is only available as part of the Infotainment package with option id PYX, the Infotainment small package with option id PY3 and the MMI Navigation Pro pacakge with option ID PYH\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/exterior/wheels/spare/","title":"Audi e-tron spare wheels","tags":[],"description":"As an option to e-tron you can get an inflatable spare wheels.","content":"Option ID 3F1 This has a required combination of jack with option id 1S1\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/exterior/wheels/","title":"Audi e-tron GT wheels","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT / Audi RS e-tron GT have serveral wheels to choose from.","content":"The following wheels have been available from Audi to Audi e-tron GT.

The model is expected to have some exterior changes, bigger batteries, and some other power electronics improvements to reduce consumption.\n  Audi Q8 e-tron prototype  Audi Q8 e-tron has a wide range of options and advanced driving technologies. Here on electrichasgoneaudi.net, you find all details about e-tron. Everything from the different wheels to choose from to how the different driving assist system works.\nWanna keep yourself updated. Join our Audi Q8 e-tron facebook group.\nAudi Q8 e-tron variants It is expected that the Audi Q8 e-tron will be available in different variants with different body designs, motors, and batteries.\n Audi Q8 e-tron 50 Audi Q8 e-tron 50 Sportback Audi Q8 e-tron 55 Audi Q8 e-tron 55 Sportback Audi Q8 e-tron S Audi Q8 e-tron S Sportback  Audi Q8 e-tron drivetrain: battery and motors Audi Q8 e-tron is built on the same MLB-Evo platform that Audi e-tron with the support of up to 3 powerful motors and a new larger batteries. Adaptive Air suspension and progressive steering are standard.\nIt is expected that the battery will be available in two sizes. The assumption is that the Audi Q8 e-tron will keep the same nominal voltage (396 volts) as the Audi e-tron and therefore the same amount of cells but each cell will be slightly larger moving from 60AH to 67AH. At the same time, the buffer is expected to be reduced to 6%, the same as Q4 e-tron and expected on Q6 e-tron.\nThis should give the following batteries (unconfirmed)\n 79.6 kWh gross / 74.9 kWh net on Audi Q8 e-tron 50 105.6 kWh gross / 99 kWh net on Audi Q8 e-tron 55 / e-tron S  Today\u0026rsquo;s Audi e-tron 55/S has a consumption between 19.1kWh/100km and 25.2kWh/100km depending on version and equipment trim. It is expected with new power electronics and some improved aerodynamics Audi will be able to lower this to 18.6kWh/100km - 24.7kWh/100km This will give the new Audi Q8 e-tron 55 / Audi Q8 e-tron S a WLTP range between 400km and 532km (248 miles - 330 miles). (up from 343km-452km)\nWe will know more when the Audi Q8 e-tron is finalized and tested by WLTP standards.\nAudi Q8 e-tron exterior There will be a huge number of exterior options to the Audi Q8 e-tron. More than 50 Paint colors, two body shapes, wheels from 19\u0026quot; - 22\u0026quot;, paint styles, different optics, mirror types, and many more options make it possible to create your unique design.\nAudi Q8 e-tron interior Audi Q8 e-tron will a have luxury interior with many options. This includes four different seat types including seats with massage and ventilation.\nDifferent interior designs, interior lights, and many more so that you can personalize the car as you like it.\nAudi Q8 e-tron technology Vorsprung Durch Technik have in more than 50 years been Audis mantra and Audi Q8 e-tron is no exception. It will be loaded with advanced technology in many areas like Driver Assistance, lights, charging technology, and many more areas to give you a safe, comfortable, and luxurious journey.\nCompared to Audi e-tron the Audi Q8 e-tron is expected to have new lights and a new and updated MMI with a larger main screen.\nAudi Q8 e-tron dimensions The dimensions on the Audi Q8 e-tron will be the same as the Audi e-tron.\nTransportation capabilities In addition to the 5 seats, the Q8 e-tron has both a trunk and a frunk in addition to roof storage and trailer capabilities.\nVideo below show testing of 2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/technology/battery/cellbalancing/","title":"Cell balancing","tags":[],"description":"Cell balancing is important to get the most of the battery.","content":"Cell balancing is needed when a group of cells has higher or lower SOC than other groups of cells.\nIn this example, the top group of cells is 100% charged and the charging procedure is complete. However, the high-voltage battery charge level is only 96 %. Balancing means that this cell is now discharged via a resistor and can thereby continue to be charged until all cells have reached the same charge level. This allows the high-voltage battery to achieve its maximum capacitance.\nTo do this, the battery regulation control unit compares the voltages of the cell groups. If cell groups have a high cell voltage, the battery modules control unit responsible receives the balancing information. Balancing is performed when voltage differences of greater than approx. 1% occurs when the high-voltage battery is being charged. After the ignition has been switched off, the battery regulation control unit checks whether balancing is necessary and triggers it if necessary. Typical balancing is performed at charge levels greater than 30%.\nOn all-electric Audis, it is not possible to check the cell balance without extra tools. ODBEleven is one of these tools that can be used. The below screenshot show that one cell set has 10% SOC and another has 13% soc. Audi e-tron has 108 cell sets with 3 or 4 cells in parallel depending on the version.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron GT interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":"The interior of the e-tron GT conveys the ultimate gran turismo feel by radiating sportiness, comfort, and expanse in equal measure. Sustainable materials also play an important part in the electric sports car.\nThe interior: sporty and spacious The strong focus of the interior on the driver – inspired by the “monoposto” concept, a typical design feature of the sporty Audi models – is a characteristic of the e-tron GT. The upper section of the three-dimensional instrument panel is drawn away from the driver in a large, elegant arc. This space is occupied by the display of the Audi virtual cockpit plus, which is shaded by its own cowl. The flat-bottomed steering wheel features multifunction buttons, and its rim can be heated as an option (standard with the RS model ).\nThe center console is tilted toward the driver, and the central MMI touch display is conveniently located in its upper section, where is it easy to see. It is surrounded by a black piano finish bezel that seems to float above the instrument panel and tapers into a wing to the right. When the ambient lighting package plus is on board, the bezel bears a lasered and backlit “e-tron” badge. The standard three-zone automatic air-conditioning is located above the central air vents, where it is easy to reach.\nThe entire instrument panel appears lean and light. It is divided into horizontal levels, creating width and spatial depth. This impression is emphasized effectively in the dark by the ambient lighting package plus with its 30 adjustable colors (standard in the RS model ). The central level spans the entire width of the interior. The lateral air vents underline this sense of width: Aluminum brackets surround their tips that plunge deep into recesses in the door trims. The flowing lines of the door rail visually merge in a straight line into the fender contours of the front section, inspired by the quattro blisters on the exterior.\nThe driver and passenger sit in a sporty low position, separated by the wide center tunnel. The selector switch for the gears, which provides a highly precise haptic control experience, is situated on its console. The rear seats also offer enough space for adults, as their backrests can be folded forward in the ratio 40:20:40. The uncompromisingly high quality and processing of the materials documents the attention to detail with which Audi develops and builds cars.\nSee video for more details.\n  Sustainable is the new premium: materials, fabrics, colors, and equipment The front seats are available in three designs. Available as standard in the e-tron GT quattro are the sport seats with electric eight-way adjustment and artificial leather/pearl Nappa leather covers. The RS e-tron GT is equipped with sport seats plus with 14-way adjustment, lumbar support and seat heating.\nThe sport seats pro with 18-way adjustment, pneumatic side bolsters, climate control, and (upon request) a massage function are available as an option for both models. In both seat variants, a bezel in the area of the head restraint further sharpens the sporty contour. The seats and steering wheel of the RS model feature special badges, and the pedal caps and footrest are made of stainless steel.\nFor fans with exquisite taste: the design packages The black leather-free design package is available for the sport seats plus. Upholstery is available either as a combination of artificial leather and the Kaskade material or as a mixture of artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica. In both cases, the covers consist predominantly of materials such as polyester fibers that were made from recycled PET bottles, textiles, or residual fibers. Each set of Kaskade covers is made of 119 recycled plastic bottles. Dinamica is a breathable microfiber material made proportionally from recycled polyester fibers and recycled PET. Kaskade is reminiscent of natural fibers such as wool and offers a very pleasant seating feel. The stitching of the seat center panels of both covers is based on the look of the Singleframe.\nThe sport seats pro are made of a combination of two types of leather: fine Nappa leather for the side bolsters and pearl Nappa leather with a perforated honeycomb pattern for the center panels. They are available in black, Santos brown, Arras red, or Monaco gray. The seat colors harmonize with the color-matched interior. In the red and gray RS design packages, red or gray contrasting stitching contrasts with black covers; the seat belts also come in red or gray.\nAudi offers a broad range of upholstery materials, from artificial leather and Dinamica and all the way to full leather, for the upper section of the instrument panel, the steering wheel rim, the door trims, the armrests, and the center console. The floor carpet and floor mats in both models are generally made of Econyl, a material that consists of 100-percent recycled nylon fibers. These fibers are gained from production waste, fabric and carpet remnants, or old fishing nets.\nThe large application area on the instrument panel is painted in a fine paint finish, graphite gray or palladium silver (in the RS model ). Open-pore walnut wood decor or silk-matt carbon with twill are available as alternatives. With the ambient lighting package plus, the “e-tron GT” logo is projected onto the ground when the driver’s door is opened. While aluminum inserts for the door sill trims are standard, the range extends all the way to carbon material with illumination.\nThe Audi exclusive program from Audi Sport GmbH fulfills many personal customer requests for equipment, in particular with regard to leather, the stitching, and the seat belts, which are available with colored edges. The cognac/jet gray design package is available as an upscale all-in-one solution. The seats are upholstered with brown fine Nappa leather here, and gray contrasting stitching throughout the interior adds highlights from the steering wheel rim to the floor mats.\nBelow you find all details about the interior options.\n Audi e-tron GT seats Audi e-tron GT have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi e-tron GT steering wheels Audi e-tron GT have serveral steering wheel options\n  Headliner design You can order the e-tron GT with two different interior headliner colors\n  Inlays You can choose between different inlays\n  Interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron GT / Audi RS e-tron GT has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  Interior materials You can select specific interior materials to give Audi e-tron GT a more exclusive look\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has a luxury interior with many options on seats, interior design, interior lights, and many more so that you can personalize the car as you like it.","content":"Below you find the different options.\n Audi e-tron seats and interior materials Audi e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi e-tron steering wheels Audi e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\n  Audi e-tron button styles You can order the e-tron with different button styles\n  Audi e-tron headliner design You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors\n  Audi e-tron inlays You can choose between different inlays\n  Audi e-tron interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  Audi e-tron S-Line interior S-Line interior gives a sporty look inside from unique S-line options.\n  Audi e-tron rear door curtains You can order the e-tron with curtains on the rear door\n  Audi e-tron interior materials You can add interior leather to the car to give it a more exclusive look\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":"In addition you can select different types of lightning, steeringwheels, interior design.\n Audi Q4 e-tron seats and interior materials Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\n  Audi Q4 e-tron steering wheels Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\n  Interior \u0026amp; Ambient lights Audi Q4 e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\n  Audi Q4 e-tron Interior Storage Audi Q4 e-tron has lots of storage options inside\n  "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/exterior/mirrors/","title":"Audi e-tron GT mirrors","tags":[],"description":"The mirrors can be delivered in 3 different styles and with different functionality.","content":"Functionality Electric adjustable mirrors are standard on Audi e-tron (option ID 6XD).

This makes the SSP key to autonomous driving. At the same time, considerable economies of scale are achieved, whilst also reducing complexity and development costs.\nBy combining different modules with various sizes of platform, the Group’s brands also have a host of opportunities to differentiate themselves.\nFrom 2025, Audi’s Artemis project will use significant SSP modules for the first time. In 2026, Volkswagen will introduce this technology to the high-volume segment with its first model based on the SSP – the “Trinity” project.\nModels The first models from Audi on this platform is expected to by\n Audi A8 e-tron (2025) (Artemis project) Audi Q8 e-tron (2026) (Apollon project)  Configuration With SSP the car models can be configured in different setups to support models from VW to Porsche.\nBattery As PPE and J1 the SSP platform will use 800 volt technology.\nOne of the key changes to the battery on SSP compared to other platforms is that new unified cell battery technology. VW’s unified cell technology uses the same physical pack formats, just with different chemistries inside, to make designing future EVs less expensive and requiring less time.\nUnified Software platform With more and more integrated functionality and a higher need for integrating sensors and Autonomous driving capabilities, Volkswagen has decided to create a new integrated software platform to be used on the different models of the different brands.\nThis will always be connected to receiving software updates, compared with today\u0026rsquo;s platform where updates require visits to the dealer.\nVW has created a new company, called Cariad which is responsible for this.

In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only series-production Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 45 e-tron and the Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.\nEntry-level model: the Q4 35 e-tron The entry-level models Audi Q4 35 e-tron are equipped with the compact battery that has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross). An electric motor with an output of 125 kW (170 PS) and torque of 310 Nm provides the drive. In both body variants, it accelerates the electric SUV from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.0 seconds and produces a governed top speed of 160 km/h. The Q4 35 e-tron can cover up to 341 kilometers (211.9 mi) (WLTP cycle) on a single battery charge, while the Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron does up to 349 kilometers (216.9 mi) (WLTP).\nRange of up to 520 kilometers (323.1 mi): the Q4 40 e-tron The Audi Q4 40 e-tron features the large battery, which stores a net 76.6 kWh of energy (82 kWh gross). The electric motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm in this configuration. It is the same motor (APP310) used.\nEntry model with two electric motors: the Q4 45 e-tron quattro The Q4 45 e-tron quattro run on the 76.6 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality.\nTop model with two electric motors: the Q4 50 e-tron quattro The top models Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro also run on the 77 kWh battery (82 kWh gross). It supplies two electric motors that combine to produce a maximum output of 220 kW (299 PS)(Maximum output determined according to UN-GTR.21.) and 460 Nm (339.3 lb-ft) of torque, while making electric all-wheel drive become a reality. The rear motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm, the front motor 80 kW (109 PS) and 162 Nm. The electric motors keep reserves available for certain driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output.\nThe full power is only available above 80% SOC. See Performance\nMotor technology While there are three motor configurations there are only two types of electric motors used on Q4 e-tron\nAPP310 - Rear electric motor It is the same rear electric motor on all versions of Q4, but it perform different on Q35 vs Q40/Q45/Q50 because of different battery pack.

For efficiency reasons the front e-axle comes into action only when high power or a strong grip is needed.\nGearbox The powerful APP310 e-drive unit transmits power to the driven wheels using an extremely compact gearbox. The Q4 single gear is able to cope with all driving situations. The mechanism used has only a small number of cogs. This 1-speed gearbox is part of the electric drive system for the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) and is manufactured by Volkswagen Group Components at the Kassel plant.\nThermal management The motors are liquid cooled. Each motor has liquid stator cooling to give maximum thermal robustness under all operating conditions\nPerformance To protect the battery and other electronics Audi reduces the available power depending on SOC and temprature.\nFor Q50 boost the full power is only avaible over 80%. After that it will drop down against 265HP. This screenshot show how the boost level is about 50% at 66% SOC.\nBut also for the other models it will reduce power below 100% when SOC is reduced or temprature is low.\nExamples\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q6-e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi Q6 e-tron motors","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q6 e-tron will have different motor configurations.","content":"TODO when we know :-)\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/exterior/panoramicroof/","title":"Audi e-tron panoramic roof","tags":[],"description":"If you want to stand out in the crowd you can order your e-tron with panoramic roof.","content":"The roof can be openeded.

Each module is fitted with its own computer that monitors the temperature and voltage. The unusually high system voltage of approx. 800 volts enables a powerful continuous output and shortens the charging duration; in addition, it reduces the weight of, and space required by, the wiring.\nThe battery system is located beneath the passenger compartment, at the lowest point of the car. This, in combination with the electric motors, provides a low center of gravity appropriate for a sports car and a weight distribution between the front and rear axles that is very close to the ideal value of 50:50.\nThirty modules form the lower level of the battery that features a wide recess in the rear section. It creates space for the rear passengers’ feet, which allows them to sit in a low position and also enables the flat vehicle silhouette. The upper “floor” contains three further modules situated below the rear seats. The connections, fuses, and the main control unit are located under the console of the center tunnel. The bottom of the battery is protected by an aluminium plate.\nCell technology The cell used is LG Chem E66A. The cell type is LG Pouch Cell produced in Poland.\n   Spec Value     Nominal Capacity 64.6 Ah   Minimum Capacity 63,5 Ah   Nominal Voltage 3,651515 V   Nominal energy 235,888 Wh   Minimum energy 232,2 Wh   Thickness 11,7 mm   Width 104 mm   Height 350 mm   Volume 0,425880   Weight 897 g   Volumetric Energy Density 648 Wh/L   Gravimetric Energy Density 263 Wh/kg   Chemistry NCM 712    Battery pack capacity The confiugration of the battery cells are 198s2p, meaning there is two and two cells in paralell with 198 pairs in serial.\nAudi/Porsche rates the capacity to each cell to 64.6Ah or 129.2Ah per cell pair.\nThe nominal voltage is 198 * 3.65151515 = 723 Volt.\n723 volt * 129.2Ah gives = 93400Wh or 93.4kWh as stated.\nFully charged it cell 4.217 Volt in total 835Voltage. Empty each cell has 3.08 volt giving in a pack voltage on 610 Volt.\nTotal battery weight is 630 kg (1389 pound).\nEach module weighs aprox 13kg.\nMax charging speed is 270kW.\nBattery housing The waterproof housing is a sandwich construction consisting of a cover at the top and a bulkhead plate at the bottom. The truss-design battery frame with multiple subdivisions is mounted in between. The cooling elements are glued on underneath the bulkhead plate.\nThe battery housing is secured by means of a steel protective plate. For the battery frame, the developers opted for a lightweight aluminium design. On the one hand, this provides a lot of installation space for the cell modules - and consequently a high battery capacity. On the other hand, this has made it possible for the vehicle weight to be kept low. Modern joining techniques are used such as MIG welding (metal welding with inert gases) on the battery frame, laser welding on the bulkhead and protection plates and heat-conducting adhesive on the line system under the battery (see below).\nThermal managment Beneath the cell space of the battery, there is a compound structure of flat extruded sections through which a glycol/water mixture flows that circulates in its own low-temperature circuit. The temperature is transferred between the cooling plates and the cell space via a heat-conducting paste. The battery’s feel-good temperature is between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius, and its operating range extends from minus 30 to plus 50 degrees.\nFour separate coolant circuits, each at its own temperature level, regulate the temperature in the high-voltage components and the interior precisely and quickly. They can be interconnected flexibly as required. If the driver demands a high output several times in a row, valves couple the coolant circuit of the battery with the refrigerant circuit of the air-conditioning system – this intensive cooling keeps the performance of the drive at a consistently high level. The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT can accelerate to full speed from a standstill up to ten consecutive times.\nThe refrigerant circuit also helps with cooling during fast DC charging, which can heat the battery up to 50 degrees Celsius. The thermal management is connected to the navigation system. When the driver sets an HPC terminal (High Power Charging) as the destination, the cooling of the battery is already intensified on the way to the charging station so that it can be charged as quickly as possible. Should the battery still be very cold shortly after the car is started in winter, it is heated for fast charging.\nThe standard equipment of the e-tron GT includes a heat pump that heats the interior with the waste heat of the high-voltage components. It can reduce the loss of range that the electric climate control causes in winter in particular significantly. In addition to charging, customers can also manage pre-entry climate control of the interior via their smartphones using the myAudi app. This is done via a powerful high-voltage heating element and does not depend on the car charging via the power grid. Audi equips the e-tron GT with a deluxe auxiliary air-conditioning system as an option that also incorporates the steering wheel rim (if heatable), the exterior mirrors and the rear window.\n  Reduced power when cold When battery is cold the car reduces the avaialable power to protect the battery. In cold weather you should try to AC charge before leaving home to increase temprature.\n  Reduced power avaiable in cold weather  You can read more about how Audi protects the battery in this article.\nCharging The charging flaps of the gran turismo are located behind the front wheels. Both sides feature connections for alternating current (AC) and there is also a connection for direct current (DC) on the right-hand side. The Audi e-tron GT is delivered to its customers with two charging cables as standard: one mode 3 cable for public AC terminals and the charging system compact for the garage. The e-tron GT can charge with 11 kW AC as standard, which allows it to recharge an empty battery overnight. An optional onboard charger for 22 kW is available.\nAt a direct current terminal with a voltage of 800 V, for example in the European freeway network from Ionity, the Audi e-tron GT achieves a peak charging capacity of up to 270 kW. This allows it to recharge energy for up to 100 kilometers (62.1 mi) in just over five minutes, and charging from five to 80 percent SoC (state of charge) takes less than 22.5 minutes under ideal conditions. The driver can restrict the charging target in the MMI operating system, for example if the rate appears too high.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi e-tron battery","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron is delivered with two different battery sizes. 95kWh and 71kWh.","content":"Cell technology Audi/Volkswagen has a multi-vendor strategy on cells.

It is expected that from the 2023-model there will be added a larger pack.\n95kWh battery The battery for the Audi e-tron 55/e-tron 60S is totally on 95kWh and with a nominal voltage of 396 volts.\nIt consists of 36 modules with 12 cells each that give a total of 432.\nThe cells in each module are connected in 4p3s configuration. Meaning 4 and 4 cells are grouped in parallel and then connected in serial.\nSince each cell is on 60ah each parallel group gives a capacity of 240Ah. (4 x 60ah)\nWhen 36 modules like this are connected in serial the nominal voltage is 396 volt.\n396volt * 240ah = 95 040 Watt-hour (Wh) or 95kWh (kilo Watt Hours)\nEach module is on 11 Volt and has a capacity of 240 x 11 = 2640 Wh or 2.64 kWh.\nEach module weighs approx 13kg.\nTotal battery weight is 1532.2lb (699,99 kg)\nFor models produced before week 47 in 2019, the available battery is 83.6 kWh. This has part number 1 AX2. For models produced after that, the buffer has been decreased so the available capacity is 86.5 kWh increasing the range by 3,4%.\n71kWh battery The battery for the Audi e-tron 50 is totally on 71kWh and was created to support a cheaper e-tron.\nIt has a total of 27 modules with 12 cells each that give a total of 324 cells. It is no coincidence that it has 27 modules.\nOne important factor was that it has to have the same nominal voltage at 396 volts.\nThis was possible by changing the battery architecture from 4 cells in parallel to 3 cells in parallel.\nSince each cell is on 60ah each parallel group gives a capacity of 180Ah. (3 x 60ah)\nWhen 27 modules like this are connected in serial the nominal voltage is 396 volt.\n396volt * 180ah = 71 280 Watt-hour (Wh) or 71kWh (kilo Watt Hours)\nEach module is on 14.666 Volt and has a capacity of 14.666 x 14.666 = 2640 Wh or 2.64 kWh.\nBattery housing The 71kWh battery consist of 27 modules and all are located on the same \u0026ldquo;floor\u0026rdquo;.\nMost of the battery housing parts are reused with the larger 95kWh battery. The 95kWh uses a second floor under the rear seats to get the room needed for the 36 modules.\nThe diagram below shows how the e-tron 50 / e-tron Sportback 50 has fewer modules.\nSophisticated measures have been taken to protect the high-voltage battery of the Audi e\u0002tron. A strong enclosing frame of cast aluminum nodes and extruded sections, plus an aluminum plate 3.5 millimeters (0.1 in) thick protect against damage from accidents or curbs. Inside, a framework-like aluminum structure reinforces the battery system. Also comprised of extruded sections, it holds the cell modules like a typecase.\nIncluding the housing with its sophisticated crash structures comprising 47 percent extruded aluminum sections, 36 percent aluminum sheet, and 17 percent diecast aluminum parts, the battery system weighs around 700 kilograms (1,543.2 lb). It is bolted to the body structure of the Audi e-tron at 35 points. This increases its torsional rigidity by 27 percent and contributes to the high level of the safety of the Audi e-tron, as does the cooling system bonded to the outside of the battery housing. Compared to a conventional SUV, the Audi e-tron offers 45 percent higher torsional rigidity, a key parameter for precise handling and acoustic comfort\nThermal management The battery packs are created to give high performance over a large range of temperature and charge levels.\nA cooling system of flat aluminum extruded sections divided uniformly into small chambers has the task of maintaining the battery’s high-performance operation over the long term.\nHeat is exchanged between the cells and the cooling system beneath them via a thermally conductive gel pressed beneath each cell module. In what is a particularly efficient solution, the gel evenly transfers the waste heat to the coolant via the battery housing.\nThe battery and all of its parameters, such as charge status, power output, and thermal management, are managed by the external battery management controller (BMC). This is located in the occupant cell on the right A-pillar of the Audi e-tron. The BMC communicates both with the control units of the electric motors and the cell module controllers (CMC), each of which monitors the current, voltage, and temperature of the modules.\nThe battery junction box (BJB), into which the high-voltage relays and fuses are integrated, is the electrical interface to the vehicle. Enclosed in a die-cast aluminum housing, it is located in the front section of the battery system. Data exchange between the BMC, the CMCs, and the BJB is via a separate bus system.\n  Charging performance Audi e-tron 55/S and Audi e-tron 50 is one of the fastest charging EVs on the market.\nFor the 71kWh battery, the max charge speed is 125kW\nFor the 95kWh battery, the max charging speed is 150kW.\nDiagramm from FASTNED\nThere are several cars with higher top speed on charging, but the consistently high performance from low SOC to high SOC makes it overall faster than most other cars.\nCharging curve\nSee video comparison below.\n  In cold weather, the charging speed typical will get lower in the beginning until the temprature comes up. Audi e-tron does not pre-heat the battery before charging.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron battery","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron have two different variants of the battery","content":"The drive portfolio of the two compact electric models lives up to the expectations of very different groups of customers – from the urban commuter to the long-distance driver.

This ensures that its full power – and therefore the power of the entire drive system – is available after a short time even in extremely cold conditions. Thanks to the stable thermal conditions, the driver can also call on it repeatedly or charge the battery at an HPC charging terminal with high output. The sophisticated thermal management system also gives the battery a long life cycle – Audi guarantees that it will still have at least 70 percent capacity after eight years of operation or after 160,000 kilometers.\n  Detail walkthrough of battery Below you see Sandy Munro go in details about the Q4 battery.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q6-e-tron/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi Q6 e-tron battery","tags":[],"description":"The lithium-ion battery system of the Audi Q6 e-tron can store up 100 kWh of energy and uses 800 volt system.","content":"It is expected that Q6 will come with two different battery sizes.\n 100kWh gross with 12 modules 83.3kWh gross with 10 modules  It is expected that the available battery would be 94%.

This Audi carbide brake system increases the braking performance and reduces wear and therefore brake dust. At the same time it prevents flash rust, a typical phenomenon seen in many electric cars that do not use their wheel brakes very often.\nThe top-of-the-line offering for both models includes brake disks made of carbon fiber ceramic, which are especially lightweight, powerful, and durable. They have a diameter of 420 millimeters (16.5 in) on the front axle, and their ten-piston calipers are painted in gray as standard, or in red or blue as an option.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/brakes/","title":"Audi e-tron brakes","tags":[],"description":"The Audi e-tron is the first electric series production model uses an electrohydraulically integrated brake control system.","content":"The wheel brakes are actuated hydraulically, the reinforcement is actuated electrically, and the activation is actuated electronically.\nThe control unit detects with how much force the driver is depressing the brake pedal and calculates how much braking torque is needed within milliseconds.\nIf the recuperation torque is not sufficient, hydraulic pressure for the conventional friction brake is generated in addition. Put into motion by an electric spindle drive, the displacement piston pushes the brake fluid into the brake lines. The transition from the engine brake to the pure friction brake is smooth, and the driver does not notice it.\nA second piston generates the familiar pedal feeling for the driver’s foot by means of a pressure-resistant element. Thanks to this brake pedal simulator, the driver is not affected by what is happening in the hydraulics. In the case of ABS braking, pressure buildup and reduction are not noticeable in the form of irritating hard pulsations.\nThe electrohydraulic brake system is activated when the driver depresses the left-hand pedal so hard that the deceleration exceeds 0.3 g; otherwise, the Audi e-tron decelerates through recuperation via the two electric motors. The brake control system build up brake pressure for the wheel brakes with great precision and roughly twice as fast as a conventional system.\nWhen automated emergency braking is performed, there are only 150 milliseconds between the initiation of the brake application and the presence of maximum brake pressure between the pads and disks. This is barely more than a blink of the eye and creates impressively short braking distances. Even at a very slow speed, such as during maneuvering, the car decelerates via the wheel brakes because this is more efficient than electric braking in this case. Otherwise, the electric motor would have to use valuable battery current to decelerate actively at low rotational speeds.\nThe “brake-by-wire” technology of the electrohydraulically integrated brake control system enables a larger air gap, i.e. a greater distance between the brake pad and brake disk, to be set. This minimizes possible friction and heat generation and contributes actively to the vehicle’s long range.\nRecuperation The recuperation technology in e-tron can significantly increase range, depending on topografy on roads.\nOn e-tron 55 and 50 the recuperation can reach 220kW depending on speed. On e-tron S it can reach 275kW.

The e-tron GT quattro accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 4.1 seconds; the RS model achieves this in just 3.3 seconds.","content":"Both values apply for boost with launch control, which the driver can access in “dynamic” mode of the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. The RS model reaches the 200 km/h (124.3 mph) mark in 10.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). The e-tron GT quattro has a top speed of 245 km/h (152.2 mph).\nIn the e-tron GT quattro, the front electric motor outputs 175 kW (238 PS), and the rear motor outputs 320 kW (435 PS). Both electric motors keep reserves available for extreme driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output of 350 kW (476 PS) considerably. Up to 390 kW (530 PS) are available for roughly 2.5 seconds in boost mode via launch control. The total torque is 630 Nm (464.7 lb-ft). In the RS e-tron GT, the electric motor at the front axle also outputs 175 kW (238 PS), while the motor in the rear outputs 335 kW (456 PS). The total output is 440 kW (598 PS), and the total torque is 830 Nm (612.2 lb-ft). In boost mode, the output briefly increases to 475 kW (646 PS).\nMore copper in the stator: the hairpin winding The PSM motors (permanently excited synchronous motors) in the e-tron GT are extremely efficient, with an efficiency of considerably more than 90 percent in the majority of all driving situations. They are produced with a complex technology known as hairpin winding. The coils of the stator consist of rectangular copper wires that look similar to hairpins after they have been bent. This allows the wires to be packed more tightly, as a result of which considerably more copper fits into the stator as compared to the conventional round winding. This increases the output and torque and makes the cooling of the electric motors, which takes place via a separate medium-temperature circuit, more efficient.\nThe electric motor, the power electronics, and the transmission form a compact block on both axles. The front motor is installed coaxially and has a ratio of 8.1:1. The rear electric motor is installed parallel to the axles and sends its torque to a two-speed transmission with three shafts. The second gear (ratio of 8.2:1) provides excellent efficiency and also large amounts of reserve power. The first gear, which has a very short ratio of 15.6:1, ensures spirited acceleration right from the start, if the driver so desires. If the driver decides against this, the car moves off in first gear. The driver generally does not need to press a start button to drive off and can just depress the brake pedal and engage the “D” or “R” gear. As soon as they take their foot off the brake pedal, the car starts to roll at low speed.\nThe new generation of quattro: the electric all-wheel drive The electric all-wheel drive in the e-tron GT quattroand RS e-tron GT regulates the drive torque distribution between the axles – continuously, fully variably, and within a few thousandths of a second. The electric gran turismo thus offers powerful dynamism and optimum traction in any weather conditions. The quattro principle of the four-wheel drive that Audi introduced to the market more than 40 years ago presents itself on a new, fascinating technological level.\nWhen the e-tron GT is being driven in the “comfort” mode of Audi drive select, both electric motors work together in the most energy-conserving way possible. In “dynamic” mode, its character is more rear-heavy, while “efficiency” mode clearly prioritizes front-wheel drive. With a slippery road surface, high power requirements, or fast cornering, more torque can be distributed to the rear wheels – and around five times faster than with a mechanical quattro drivetrain.\nEfficiency takes priority: coasting or recuperation When the driver releases the right-hand pedal, the drive of the e-tron GT generally switches to coasting. This strategy prevents the losses associated with every conversion of energy. The large gran turismo glides calmly and efficiently while its electric motors run along virtually deenergized. Coasting recuperation takes place at the front electric motor and only in the “dynamic” mode of Audi drive select.\nRegardless of the driving mode, the driver can use the rocker switches on the steering wheel to adjust two manual recuperation levels of different strengths. They can select an automatic level in the MMI system, where the rocker switches are non-functional. In this case, the predictive efficiency assist regulates coasting and recuperation on the basis of data which is obtains from the navigation system and the onboard sensors. For example, when the car is approaching a roundabout or a slower car driving in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce the speed by coasting. If the available distance is too short, it switches to recuperation. In this case, maximum deceleration is slightly higher than in the manual recuperation levels, reaching up to 0.13 g.\nBrake recuperation: output of up to 265 kW While braking, the electric motors perform decelerations alone up to around 0.3 g, i.e. the vast majority of all brake applications in everyday driving. The hydraulic wheel brakes are activated only when the driver brakes very heavily. The transition is almost unnoticeable, and recuperation remains active almost up to a standstill. If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 265 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the gran turismo remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi e-tron electric motors &amp; setup","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has powerful electric motors and was the first EV to have a tri-motor configuration.

If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 275 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the Audi e-tron remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\nDifferential and electric torque vectoring In addition to electric all-wheel drive, Audi e-tron S are equipped with electric torque vectoring:\nFor reasons relating to efficiency, the rear electric motors in the Audi e-tron S and e-tron S Sportback provide propulsion when driving normally. The front electric motor is deenergized, but flashes into action when the driver demands more output, or predictively before slip occurs when driving on slippery roads or cornering at high speed. This electric all-wheel drive is now being enhanced with electric torque vectoring at the rear axle: Each of the two electric motors send their torques directly to the wheel via a transmission; there is no longer a mechanical differential.\nThanks to the spontaneity of the electric motors, electric torque vectoring, that is the distribution of the torque between the rear wheels, takes place within milliseconds. The time offset as compared to a mechanical system is shorter by a factor of four. It can also manage considerably higher torque: When the driver accelerates out of a corner at a sporty speed, the outside rear wheel is subject to 220 Nm (162.3 lb-ft) more than the inside wheel. Due to the gear ratio, the difference at the wheels is around 2,100 Nm (1,548.9 lb-ft). The yaw moment that is generated supports the steering characteristics and the curve radius can be retained with a smaller steering angle. Electric torque vectoring also offers great strengths in terms of pure traction: If one of the rear wheels is on very slippery ground during acceleration, e.g. a patch of ice or gravel, it receives no torque. Almost all of the torque is transferred to the wheel that has stronger traction.\nA prerequisite for the high speed and precision with which the electric all-wheel drive and the electric torque vectoring work is the close linking of the following control units: the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC), the drive control unit (ASG), the electronic chassis platform (ECP), and the control units of the performance electronics, which output voltage pulses up to 10,000 times per second. All software functions, apart from the ESC, are Audi in-house developments that benefit from the brand’s roughly 40 years of quattro experience.\nThe ECP is the mastermind among the control units: It makes the crucial contribution to the management of the all-wheel drive and electric torque vectoring. It calculates the ideal distribution of longitudinal and transverse torque on the basis of the data from the sensors that continuously inform it on the car’s driving condition and the driver’s request. One of its tasks is wheel-selective torque control: At the dynamic limit, the unloaded front wheel on the inside of the curve is braked slightly via the wheel brake. This minor, almost unnoticeable intervention prevents slip and makes handling even more agile and neutral.\n     "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/soundsystem/","title":"Audi e-tron GT soundsystem","tags":[],"description":"You can choose between two different sound systems on Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT","content":"Audi sound system The standard sound system is a 150 Watt 6 channel system with 10 speakers including center speaker and subwoofer.\nOptionId 9VD\nBang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound offers a fascinating feature for hi-fi fans – sound that includes the spatial dimension of height.

The type of damping control provided varies between the two running gear versions, adaptive air suspension and adaptive air suspension sport that is standard on e-tron S and S-Line e-tron.\nThe adaptive air suspension – an air suspension system with controlled damping – offers a wide range between smooth cruising and sporty handling. Depending on the speed and the driver’s preferences, it individually adjusts the ride height according to the road conditions. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.\nThe central chassis control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP), individually controls the function of the shock absorbers on each wheel at cycles in the order of milliseconds – according to the road surface condition, driving style and the mode the driver sets in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. Solenoid damper valves vary the volumetric flow of the hydraulic fluid.\nAdaptive Air Suspension has optionId 1BK and adaptive air suspension sport has option ID 2MB\nRegulating characteristics The regulating characteristics (regulation of ride heights depending on vehicle speed and mode) are identical on both versions. On other Audis like Q7 and Q8 the Adaptive Sport Suspension is 1cm lower. But this is not the case on Audi e-tron.\nThe diagram below show how this is adjusted depending on speed.\nThe illustration shows the control strategy for the air suspension systems. By selecting the preferred driving mode in Audi drive select, the driver determines the vehicle’s ride height and dynamic characteristics. At the same time, different ride heights are also automatically set within the selected driving mode, depending on the current vehicle speed. An example of this can be seen in the control strategy when “auto” mode is selected: If the vehicle is currently set to a different ride height, the normal level is set by changing the volume of air in the air springs if the mode is selected when the vehicle is stationary or travelling at a speed below 120 km/h.\nIf the vehicle subsequently exceeds a speed of 120 km/h, the ride height will immediately be lowered by 13 mm to low level 1. If the speed then increases further to at least 140 km/h and remains there for 20 seconds, the ride height will be lowered again by a further 13 mm to motorway level. If the speed is subsequently reduced again and the vehicle is driven at a speed of 110 km/h or lower for a duration of 30 seconds, the ride height is raised by 13 mm to the ride height previously set. If the speed is reduced further to 5 km/h, the vehicle is immediately raised to the original level (normal level).\nLowering the car Even you can adjust the ride height, some want it even lower.

The gran turismo philosophy becomes a perfect experience here, too.\nThe wheel suspensions are designed as a sporty double wishbone construction. It has a classic design on the front axle, while the upper wishbones in the rear are divided into individual links. Almost all parts, including the links and subframes, are forged or cast from aluminum. The electromechanical steering has a sporty and direct ratio of 15.4:1 but without any excessive sharpness.\nAs part of the optional dynamic package with id PA2 on Audi e-tron GT and included as standard on RS e-tron GT, Audi supplies all-wheel steering. A spindle drive turns the rear wheels by a maximum of 2.8 degrees here– in opposite directions up to about 50 km/h (31.1 mph) to increase agility and handling, and in the same direction from about 80 km/h (49.7 mph) to maintain stability. Between 50 (31.1 mph) and 80 km/h (49.7 mph), depending on the driving situation, there is a continuous transition between a steering angle in opposite directions and a steering angle in the same direction. When maneuvering, the all-wheel steering reduces the turning circle by roughly 0.6 meters (2.0 ft).\nPrecision-controlled: air suspension and damping While the adaptive air suspension is optional in the Audi e-tron GT quattro, it comes as standard in the RS model. Its compressor generates a working pressure of up to 19 bar, and the three-chamber air suspension on the front and rear axles enables comfortable basic suspension. The chambers in the bellows are activated and deactivated depending on the driving situation. During smooth driving, all three of them contribute to the suspension, while only one or two chambers are active in the case of dynamic requirements such as heavy braking or high transverse acceleration – this strategy reduces the movement of the body.\nThe air suspension can adjust the body to different heights. It lowers the body by up to 10 millimeters (0.4 in) at a speed of 90 km/h (55.9 mph), and by another 12 millimeters (0.5 in) at 180 km/h (111.8 mph). When driving at a speed below 30 km/h (18.6 mph), the driver can set a lift mode that raises the body by 20 millimeters (0.8 in), for example when driving into underground parking garages. The adaptive air suspension works closely together with the controlled dampers (standard) that adjust to the circumstances at millisecond intervals. Both systems are managed by a central control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP). This connection ensures maximum precision.\nFour driving modes: Audi drive select In the Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard), the driver can specify how the dampers, electric motors, two-speed transmission, and controlled rear-axle differential lock are to operate. They can switch between the “comfort,” “efficiency,” “dynamic,” and “individual” modes via a physical switch. In “efficiency” mode, the body is lowered to the low level to promote better airflow and the top speed is limited to 140 km/h (87.0 mph); however, the driver can override this limit by stepping heavily on the accelerator pedal. In “dynamic” mode, the electric all-wheel drive, the suspension systems, and the active aerodynamics are set to a sporty mode.\nFor dynamic handling: rear-axle differential lock The controlled rear-axle differential lock, which is integrated in the ECP control operations, is available as standard with the RS e-tron GT and as part of the dynamic package option with the e-tron GT. The multi-plate clutch is its core element. It can be actuated fully variably, and the locking range extends from zero to 100 percent. The driver can perceive this on slippery road surfaces and during maximum full-stop braking in particular: In this case, the lock opens up completely, allowing the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) to brake each wheel with great precision. It improves traction and stability, increasing lateral acceleration and reducing load change behaviour through targeted torque vectoring. The rear wheel on the inside of the bend is braked in a targeted manner as the car enters a sharp corner – resulting in the car turning slightly into the bend.\nAnimation: Audi RS e-tron GT – three-chamber air suspension and all-wheel steering This animation shows the function of the Three-chamber air suspension and the all-wheel steering in the chassis of the Audi RS e-tron GT.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/","title":"Audi e-tron GT technology","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has a lot of advanced technology.

Still many experience slower charging speed than expected. Why is that?","content":"First. What is the expected charging rate? Under optimal conditions, the charge curve will look like this.\nThat means that you often see 150kW up to 80% and 100kW to 85% and still above 50kW at 100%. This makes the Audi e-tron one of the fastest charging cars on the market.\nBut people may see that their charging speed is much slower than this.\nReason 1. Cold battery The most common reason for reduced charging speed is that the battery is cold. The ideal battery temperature is about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for maximum charging performance.\nWhen the battery temperature is cold, the chemistry in the battery is not able to receive the same amount of energy, and the charging speed is reduced.\nHow to prevent it? On the Audi e-tron, there is not much you can do while driving except drive longer before you charge or harder that increases the temperature. On other models like Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT the car heats the battery if navigation is set to a High Power Charger.\nReason 2. Shared infrastructure On some chargers there is a shared infrastructure and if many charges at the same time, the speed is reduced for each charger.\nReason 3.

The reason is that in B-mode you will be ending up recuperating when not needed and that will lose energy during the conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy on the battery. Around 80% of the kinetic energy is put into the battery while recuperating. If you coast you will keep that energy as kinetic energy.\nTo be able to coast in B-mode you would need to hold foot on the throttle on a specific location, but even the best driver will not be able to shift between driving and coasting at the same speed as in D-mode.\nOn other cars, B-mode would be more efficient, but Audi has created blended brakes that always do recuperate when pressing the brake pedal if possible. That\u0026rsquo;s why you don\u0026rsquo;t waste energy using the brake pedal on the Audi Q4 e-tron.\nNote: If “dynamic” mode is set in the optional Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard in the Sportback), recuperation also takes place in gear D but at a slightly weaker rate than in B.\nHow much does it matter? Even D-mode is the most efficient in most cases the differences could be ignored. If you prefer driving with B-mode in the city (one-pedal-driving) you should just do it. The extra range you get from D-mode in the city driving probably is not something you would care about.\nOn high-way it is much more comfortable to use D-mode in addition to being more efficient.\nWant to learn more Read our one-pedal driving guide.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/knowledgeexchange/faq/","title":"Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQ)","tags":[],"description":"We have collected frequently asked questions about Audi e-tron and try to answer them for you.","content":"Charging  Why is my Audi e-tron charging speed much slower than expected  myAudi App  Why I am not able to control my car throug myAudi?

But here are some of the most common issues and solutions\nLog in and log out In some cases, and especially when you get an error message about the action can\u0026rsquo;t be performed because some other action is happening you should try to log out and log in again.\nRemove car from myAudi This option can help if you have never been able to connect to the car. Removing it from MyAudi, adding it again with VIN, and then requesting Audi to add you as the main user.\nBad network coverage where it is parked Even if you are standing 10 meters away from the car, the communication will always go through central Audi servers. If there is bad reception for the car it might not be online. The car might use another network than your cells. Depending on country and provider.\nCommon server or software issue The most common issue is that Audi servers or software have issues that prevent owners to access functionality. This happens often in winter when more users try to heat the car.\nContact Audi Digital Support\nReset of car For some owners, their dealership has disconnected the car from the 12-volt battery and in that way resetting the communication module.\nReplacement of SOS module In some cases, the communication module (SOS module) needs to be replaced.

Audi does not give only one number on the range. The range varies a lot between the variants and depending on trim level.\nIt also depends on how the range is measured/calculated. In Europe, they use WLTP to calculate range and in the US they use EPA to calculate range. These numbers are typically different because the drive cycle in these two tests is not the same.\nWLTP Range The table below shows the range measured according to the WLTP standard.

The range indicator base its range on the following data\n Average consumption on the last 100km/62 miles driven The state of charge (of much is the battery charged) The planned route in the navigation system  So assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery and you have charged it to 100%.\nIf you check the driving data in myAudi app on short-term memory you will see your drives.\nIf we calculate the range based on the consumption on 24.12 with 30.3 kWh/100km we get\n86.5/30.3 = 285km.\nSame calculation based in miles 2.1mi/kWh\n86.5*2.1 = 181 miles.\nBut this is the best guess based on previous trips. If you change behavior on the next trip, the range calculated would be wrong.\nIf you have done many short trips in cold weather, you would have spent lots of energy to heat up the car. But this average consumption is not relevant if you the next day are taking a long drive. The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\nThe numbers do not match up, can it be something wrong? If your average consumption on our last trip does not match up with the estimated range it might be a problem with your Audi e-tron.\nWe have seen examples of defects that cause low range.\nThe first you should try is to calculate the battery capacity so you are sure there is a problem. This would also make it easier for you to document this for your dealer.\nRead this guide to calculate and verify your Audi e-tron battery status\nIf your conclusion is that the battery capacity is much lower of the specified capacity it might be one of the following problems.

The air is crisply cold and the thermometer says -21 degrees (-5.8 Fahrenheit) on this January morning. The hum of snowplows is audible outside the hotel as they push the fresh snow from the frozen lake and prepare the test tracks just a few hundred meters away. Raphael Kis has pulled his black woolen cap low over his face and is trudging through the Swedish gloom toward the workshop. The paths are short: “You could say you fall out of the hotel directly into the workshop,” Kis says. It is 7:00 – time to start work for this family man who, as an Audi calibration engineer, is responsible for tuning driving characteristics like stability and traction.\nClosed off from the outside world The workshop is on the Volkswagen Group’s extensive testing grounds in Sweden – simply called “KALT 1” for reasons of secrecy. Fences completely seal off the area in Lapland and everything is strictly confidential. This is where Audi calibrates its future models on ice and snow. The testing mecca covers more than 3,600 hectares (8,896 acres) in total – about 1.7 times the surface area of the Frankfurt airport. Apart from several workshops with office workplaces and a hotel with 440 beds, the grounds offer wintery stretches totaling 83 kilometers (51.6 miles) in length.\nThe next-largest town is several kilometers away and even the nearest supermarket is beyond walking distance. Nonetheless, the roughly 150 employees on average, who are there only for Audi, are well supplied. The all-inclusive carefree package includes three mealtimes in the hotel restaurant, two exercise rooms, and a hotel bar. “We’re together with a lot of people – you have to like that. If you’re not up for that, you won’t be able to stand it for long.” Raphael Kis has been at it for 14 years, about 20 weeks per year, of which about ten weeks are in Sweden.\n  2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype  Fine tuning in the Swedish winter This morning, Kis is sitting in a workshop office and gearing up for fine tuning a new Audi model. The next generation Audi e-tron. Expected to be re-named Audi Q8 e-tron. When his son was younger, he explained his job to him this way: “Daddy sits in a car and adjusts it so that people can drive safely.” Admittedly, it is not quite so simple – and Kis dispels one preconception right away: “I don’t drive in circles all day long, as one might imagine,” he says and grins. Here and there, new software has to be run on the car and occasionally experts also have to adjust the hardware. Calibrating a vehicle takes over a year, usually one and a half winters: Kis and his colleagues ideally establish a baseline on dry road in order to adjust the basic handling. Test drives follow on a wet road surface before the Swedish winter sets in starting in late November. Ultimately, the car should drive harmoniously on dry and wet roads as well as on ice and snow. “The ABS, ASC, and driving dynamics control have to correspond to Audi DNA,” Kis explains. The automotive group thinks of its DNA as fulfilling certain criteria that characterize an Audi’s unmistakable handling.\nCalibration in dry Spain is on the agenda for February in order to “drive against it” again in Sweden, as Kis says. “It’s a constant interplay.” The new Audi model’s handling is also refined over the course of a year on mountain roads and passes. “The different road profiles should always be as customer-oriented as possible.” The suspension experts plan on doing the final fine tuning the following winter.\nAdjustments on a laptop Thick snowflakes are still fluttering from the sky outside the window, illuminated by the light of the workshop. “December and January are the dark months in Sweden – that’s pretty tough,” the developer says. This particular day, the sun came up at 9 AM and went down again at 2 PM. Kis says that February and March are the beautiful months in the northern kingdom. That is when the sun and the blue sky occasionally transform the testing grounds into a magical winter landscape. “But you also get used to the darkness. All the roads are well lit by roof-mounted headlights,” Kis says as he wedges his laptop under his arm and grabs the car keys from the desk.\nMoments later, the laptop is firmly in its bracket on the passenger seat of a car stickered with camouflage film. Various parameters can be changed on the computer in order to get incrementally closer to the target characteristics. The Audi should be easy to control – including in the threshold range. All control systems have to respond reliably to the driving conditions that are present. Superior traction is also considered a typical Audi characteristic. Despite electric cars, tuning has not fundamentally changed over the years.\n  Adjusting behaviour  Routinized driving on thick ice Kis’ next station on the testing grounds is a stretch on the frozen lake – about three kilometers long and with the same curves each year thanks to saved GPS data. Mounds of snow that were cleared off the route early in the morning are now piled up alongside it. Conifers on the banks groan under the weight of the snow and leave their branches hanging. How will the Audi respond to the icy roadway? Kis presses on the gas pedal and the car heads for the first curve to the left.\nThe Audi drifts through the curve and swirls the snow particles a good two meters up into the icy air. “These are the moments when the job is really fun,” says Kis. The handling specialist routinely steers the car through the course a few times until he has gathered enough information.\nHe does not need to fear that the sheet of ice will not support the car. At the start of the season, the team checks the ice with a snowmobile and measures its thickness. It needs to be at least 25 to 30 centimeters (9.8-11.8 inches) for a car to be able to drive on it. If the ice is too thin, hovercraft push the snow off the surface over and over. Given that snow has an isolating effect, the ice would grow more slowly otherwise. The result is a layer of ice that is up to 90 centimeters (35.4 inches) thick.\nAnalyzing the measurement results Back in the workshop. Analyzing the measurement results with functional developers and system partners is on the agenda after lunch in the hotel restaurant. A certain personal touch is discernible in the calibration, but Kis discusses a model’s target characteristics in advance with the development team leader and other colleagues. The nuances in their opinions vary widely from one to another. “What happens is that someone thinks that the car should oversteer a little bit more, for example,” says Kis. “But all in all, we have pretty much the same understanding of how the car should drive in the end.”\nDarkness has long fallen once more over the testing grounds when Kis takes his jacket from the back of the chair and slips on his cap. Quitting time after a ten-hour workday. “Dinner, chatting with my co-workers, and a video call home. Back at it tomorrow!” Kis says and disappears into the green light of the hotel lobby.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audidna/","title":"Why an Audi drives like an Audi - the Audi DNA in the driving characteristics","tags":[],"description":"It’s a feeling most people recognize immediately- This is an Audi! The driving experience is unmistakable, a harmonious balance of driving dynamics and ride comfort.","content":"  2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype and 2022 Audi e-tron S  Decisive, in this respect, is a finely integrated interplay between the various components, whether that be suspension, steering, powertrain as well as brake and control systems. The driving DNA, that can be felt and experienced in every Audi, is defined in the concept phase of every model and then realized through both basic and final fine tuning. To achieve their aim Audi developers are guided by fundamental qualities that are used to characterize and assess driving behavior. These are: balanced, solid, controlled, networked, precise and effortless. The outcome is the driving experience that is typical of an Audi.\n“An Audi driver has to be able to feel it’s an Audi – in the form of harmonious, distinctive driving characteristics,” says Oliver Hoffmann, Audi Board Member for Technical Development. “The genes of the Audi feeling should be an unmistakable experience for the customer.” That applies to every driving situation, whether that be in stop-and-go traffic, accelerating away from urban areas, driving on twisting roads, changeable road conditions or even overtaking. “That is why the Audi DNA is also firmly entrenched in our electrically powered models,” Hoffmann explains. “At a computer, in the workshop and above all in extensive test drives, subjective and objective assessment criteria flow together in order to continuously sharpen not only the Audi driving characteristics but also the whole technical development.”\nObjective criteria support subjective driving tests An important segment of the test drives are conducted in bitterly cold northern Sweden. Here the emphasis is on finely honing the driving behavior in wintery conditions. Developers carry out subjective test drives, thereby putting their previously defined objective criteria to the test. So called “use cases” like, for example, emergency braking under wintery conditions form the basis of the tests driven. When the developers seek to tune a controlled and therefore predictable and stable driving behavior, objective measurements of initial deceleration and steering support the tuning work.\nStraight ahead stability, steering demand, and deceleration build-up are criteria for a rating methodology for ABS braking from various speeds on snow and ice. The results of tuning work flow into an assessment of driving behavior, which the developers document in the form of a spider web chart – a pattern that is applied to all Audi models on a model-specific basis. The foundation for that is the way that the vehicle and its individual characteristics are positioned and how the relevant driving maneuvers and development philosophy are defined. An Audi can be recognized by these driving characteristics: steering response, steering turn-in, traction, and steering properties. Here, the virtues of quattro are quite visible: its particularly unique driving characteristics with respect to traction in curves and straight ahead stability, as well as its steering and behavior during loads changes set the Audi all-wheel drive above the average level of the competition.\n  2022 Audi e-tron S driving characteristics  Precisely defined tuning philosophy Audi understands that a controlled driving behavior is defined by a precise and predictable steering response. To achieve these desired driving characteristics the developers follow an established tuning philosophy during test drives on snow and ice. This states that the vehicle should instantly follow the steering input upon entering a curve. Forgiving handling at the apex of the curve and low correction effort upon leaving the curve are also among the obligatory criteria.\nThe result: a predictable steering angle dependent yaw behaviour combined with a slightly oversteering balance, where understeer is avoided. Audi achieves these by using technologies like torque vectoring, the dual motor rear axle in the e-tron S, or the torque splitter in the RS 3. Developer Oswin Roeder summarizes by saying that “we describe the way that an Audi needs to drive by using objective and subjective criteria. But the subjective criteria are crucial for us as ultimately that is what drivers feel.”\n  2022 Audi e-tron S  Harmoniously tuned control systems, natural driving experience Each of the suspension control systems involved is precisely synchronized to the others. None of the systems dominate to the detriment of the driving experience. The driving experience is natural. Dynamic all-wheel steering is intentionally tuned to make a vehicle seem much smaller and manageable without creating a synthetic driving experience in the process. The systems built into an Audi are balanced and always precisely calibrated to one another. When customers order cars with air suspension, they automatically receive a steering tuning that is adjusted for the enhanced characteristics. That also applies to the combination of other systems like electromechanical active roll stabilization (eAWS), active suspension, and torque vectoring.\nFor instance, the electric quattro in the Audi e-tron S governs the torque on demand, from zero to 100 percent between the front and rear axle. On top of that, there’s electric torque vectoring for increased agility. Each of the rear electric motors distributes the drive torque directly to the wheel without any mechanical differential. This is done proactively in slippery conditions or when cornering quickly, before slippage occurs or the car understeers or oversteers. The result is highly precise handling, which can be adjusted over a wide range via the chassis control systems – from stable to sporty. In sport mode, for instance, the control systems intervene later to enable driving with more oversteer.\n  2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback prototype  Consistent system reactions, reliable driving comfort All of the vehicle systems involved need to respond consistently and reliably to the current driving conditions irrespective of the nature of the road surface. Ride comfort is a case in point. Finely tuned wheel damping avoids unpleasant phenomena like after-shake, shudder or shake, which are induced by road unevenness and often intensified by powertrain and wheel harmonic oscillation. The end result is the typical Audi ride comfort with vastly reduced secondary vibrations. The driver can hardly perceive interventions in the lateral dynamics; they are, at most, intuitively comprehensible.\nEasy car control, even at the limits of grip Drivers get a secure feeling of vehicle controllability if pronounced oscillation of the vehicle body is avoided when driving over large undulations. Therefore, tuning is intended to produce a car that is easy to control – even at the limits of grip. The underlying philosophy is to convey a feeling of consistent predictability in vehicle response. In the e-tron S, for example, the system engages the torque of the electric motors within only 30 milliseconds of recognizing the driving situation. Mechanical clutches are not utilised to apply torque in the electric all-wheel-drive system, instead electrical power is sent when and where necessary. The precision of this control systems’ interaction with the driver conveys a sense of safety. The steering is direct and gas pedal changes are immediately noticeable. It’s very easy to perceive how the vehicle’s character changes with the selected drive mode. Predictively recognizing driving situations, optimal interaction between subsystems\nThe mastermind of the regulating systems and control units is the Electronic Chassis Platform (ECP) with its integrated longitudinal and lateral torque distribution. It allows driving situations to be recognized predictively in order to adjust the vehicle as needed. It takes the speed, height values, the car’s vertical, roll, and pitching movements, the friction of the road, the current driving status, and understeering and oversteering into account, as well as information from the suspension systems involved. That network allows the ECP to ensure optimal interaction between the subsystems.\n  2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback prototype  Torque distribution in milliseconds and high perceptibility Audi aims to provide superior and easily manageable acceleration and deceleration in all driving situations. Audi lateral dynamics provide the driver with unambiguous feedback. When dynamically cornering, the front wheel inside the curve that has less load is slightly slowed down, which prevents slippage and improves handling. The electric torque vectoring in the e-tron S – the shifting of torque between the rear wheels – works similarly and particularly effectively. It happens in milliseconds and can engage extremely high torque for improved lateral dynamics. When the car accelerates out of the curve, the electric drive allocates more torque to the rear wheel on the outside of the curve and less to the rear wheel on the inside of the curve.\nSuperior traction, controlled handling – typical Audi Superior traction – especially in difficult winter conditions – and controlled handling are typical driving characteristics for Audi. An Audi should be effortlessly controllable, unperturbed even by the most difficult road conditions. Audi models are easy to manage, they feel both at home in dense urban traffic and on the highway, where they demonstrate unquestionably secure high speed stability. There is always enough power available for passing. To be able to make the best possible use of physical limits, the wheel brake at the limits of grip gently decelerates the wheel on the inside of a curve on the front axle of an e-tron S or on the front and rear axles of an e-tron. This strategy applies more drive torque to the tires on the outside of the curve and increases cornering agility. The traction control system (ASR) acts in milliseconds because Audi shifts individual functional components from the electronic stabilization control (ESC) into the power electronics directly on the electric motors.\nThe traits described form the framework with which Audi developers characterize and assess driving behavior across models in test drives on both wintery and normal surfaces. That is the only way to achieve what a customer senses when driving an Audi: This is an Audi.\n  In this interview, Carsten Jablonowski, Chassis Development AUDI AG, talks about the driving characteristics and suspension tuning of an Audi under different conditions. During the Winter Experience Drive in Sweden, the suspensions of the latest models were tested on snow and ice.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/updatedq4/","title":"Higher charging capacity and expanded online features for the Audi Q4 e-tron","tags":[],"description":"On the road with faster charge times and more connected features.

All these cars will now charge up to 135 kW of power. The ideal 5 to 80 percent charge time is reduced for the Q4 40 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback 40 e-tron to 29 minutes, for the Q4 45 e-tron quattro as well as the Q4 50 e-tron quattro and Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron quattro models to 36 minutes.\nThese improvements rely on optimized software for the battery’s thermal management and control systems. All models retain local C02-free driving, long-distance ranges, and convenient charging at some 320,000 charging points in 26 European countries with the optional e-tron Charging Service.\nAudi connect integrates Amazon Alexa* Thanks to the integration of Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa, Audi connect now lets drivers manage their calendar or shopping list by voice as well as control compatible smart home devices from their car**. Individual user profiles in the car, last-mile navigation options, and expanded app functions on the car status and parked position round out the connect portfolio.\nWith Audi connect Emergency call \u0026amp; Service, the vehicle can make an automatic emergency call in the respective national language to help route emergency responders to the right location. Quick and competent roadside assistance can be manually called by pressing the service call button in the roof module. A separate mobile phone module, independent from the customer telephone service, handles the data and audio connection with a permanently integrated SIM card mounted at a crash-proof location in the car.\nThe infotainment offering is complemented by the largest-ever display to be used in an Audi car. The optional MMI touch display featuring an 11.6-in screen with a resolution of 1,764 x 824 pixels comes standard with the MMI pro and MMI plus packages.\nNew charging features in the myAudi app The free myAudi app also offers new features. Preplanned routes can now be conveniently sent to the car right from the app. The e-tron route planner automatically plans charging stops based on the current traffic situation, taking into account the driver’s individual consumption profile.

Today at the exhibition center in Nuremberg, the first Audi charging hub is going into operation as the only charging concept of its kind in the world.","content":"  Audi charging hub  The Audi charging hub opens for customers on December 23. The modern quick-charging station with reservable high-power charging areas is oriented toward, among other things, electric car owners who don’t have any charging opportunities at home. Moreover, the Audi charging hub is intended to serve future peak demand for charging in urban environments. A connected lounge area offers a premium charging experience.\nWith the pilot location, Audi is road-testing its new charging concept for the first time. “We want to use it to test flexible and premium-oriented quick-charging infrastructure in urban space,” says Ralph Hollmig, Audi charging hub project manager. “We’re going where our customers don’t necessarily wake up in the morning with a fully charged electric car and at the same time thinking about increasing charging demand in the future.”\n  Audi charging hub  Self-sufficient and affordable charging infrastructure Cubes are the foundation of the Audi charging hub. The flexible container cubes can be assembled and disassembled again in existing areas in a few days. The cubes provide two fast-charging stations for each unit and can be combined in various constellations. Used and processed lithium ion batteries function as energy storage systems – what are known as second-life batteries taken from dismantled development vehicles. That reduces costs and resources. This makes complex infrastructure with high-voltage power lines and expensive transformers as unnecessary as time-consuming planning procedures. The Audi charging hub\u0026rsquo;s battery-storage solution will bring quick-charging infrastructure where the electric grid is not enough.\n  Audi charging hub  Thanks to the roughly 2.45 MWh of interim storage, the charging stations in Nuremberg only need a 200 kW green power connection to the low-voltage network that is already available, which is entirely sufficient for operating the Audi charging hub. The 200 kW are enough to continually fill the storage modules. Solar panels on the roof additionally provide up to 30 kW of green energy. Customers can charge electric cars with up to 320 kW of power at six charging points. A total of about 80 vehicles can be charged here per day without reaching the limits of the energy storage system’s capacity combined with the hub’s 200 kW power input.\nThe Audi e-tron GT reaches a charging capacity of up to 270 kW. That allows the four-door Coupé to charge enough energy for up to 100 kilometers in about five minutes. A charge from 5 to 80 percent takes roughly 23 minutes.\nPrices like the Wallbox at home Currently, anyone who chooses to use the high-power charging stations at the Audi charging hub in Nuremberg and have an e-tron Charging Service contract can charge for 31 cents per kilowatt hour, regardless of the rate. That makes the Audi charging hub a real alternative to charging at home. “We’re providing people in urban areas with charging at the price they would pay to charge using the Wallbox at home,” says Hollmig. The Audi charging hub in Nuremberg is an open charging site. The entrance area is even accessible for drivers of cars of other makes.\nFast and uncomplicated charging Audi customers can use the new reservation function in the myAudi app: they can easily book one of the six charging areas.\n  Audi charging hub reservation  Charging itself is quick and uncomplicated. With Plug and Charge (PnC), it is even possible to charge models with Plug and Charge functionality without an RFID (radio frequency identification) card at two of the six charging points during the pilot phase. The authentication process takes place automatically via encrypted communication as soon as the charging cable is connected to the vehicle. To use this system, drivers must have a PnC-capable model of the Audi e-tron series (Audi e-tron 50/55/S incl. Sportback derivatives with production date after calendar week 48/2021) and an active e-tron Charging Service contract. Customers can spend the 20- to 30-minutes it takes to charge up to 80 percent charging volume – for instance with an Audi e-tron or Audi e-tron GT – in the upstairs lounge.\nAttractive service offerings enhance charging time The tests that are starting in Nuremberg focus on the new reservation function, customers’ expectations of a premium charging experience, and technical aspects like the requirements for modern battery storage systems. Audi also wants to determine which times of day the facility is particularly frequently used. The goal is to establish the Audi charging hub with appropriate added value for customers. To that end, Audi is offering additional attractive services on-site beyond charging electric cars: an exchange station for electric bike batteries, an electric scooter lending service, information about various Audi products, as well as test drives in the Audi Q4 e-tron and Audi RS e-tron GT, supervised by Audi experts. Additionally, Audi offers a just-in-time delivery service for food, an upscale automat, and mobile car care.\n  Audi charging hub lounge  Service staff look after customers In the roughly 200 square meter (2,153 sq. ft.) barrier-free lounge, which also includes a 40 square meter (431 sq. ft.) patio, users’ wellbeing takes center stage. There they can work and relax. On a 98 inch screen, Audi models can be configured or information about the Audi charging hub’s functionality or a car\u0026rsquo;s current charge level can be retrieved.\nDuring the pilot project in Nuremberg, an employee will attend to visitors’ wishes between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Six charging points and a lounge are available around the clock. “Our customers will share multiple benefits,” says project manager Hollmig. “With an exclusive reservation option, a lounge area, short idle time thanks to high charging capacity, and a novel swivel arm to simplify handling the charging cable.”\n  Audi charging hub lounge  Video presentation of Audi Charge hub The following video presents the Audi Charge hub in details.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/electromobilityinwinter/","title":"Electromobility in winter-Intelligent functions optimize range and charging performance","tags":[],"description":"Seat heating instead of a hot air blower, optimum tire pressure, parking in the garage, and selecting the efficiency mode these and other factors determine how quickly the high-voltage battery is drained – or not.","content":"  Electric mobility in winter  What can Audi customers do beyond the established tips to keep the high-voltage battery in their e-tron model working efficiently during the winter and to achieve optimal range?\nDeparture timer and preconditioning Preconditioning climatizes the interior of the vehicle before departure to the desired temperature like with auxiliary heating. Apart from comfort, it is a function that also ensures more range. That is because during preconditioning with the departure timer, the energy that is needed to warm the battery in the winter is directed to the vehicle during charging via an external energy source – for instance, a home wallbox or a public charging point. The result: less heating power needs to be used while driving, which in turn benefits range. That is particularly relevant for bringing the battery to a comfortable temperature without pre-heating for energy-intensive short trips, when not much time is available.\ne-tron route planner In the purely electric models, the Audi e-tron route planner complements the Audi MMI’s (MMI = Multi Media Interface) navigation features with about 30 pieces of detailed information and helps optimize the demands of e-mobility, especially when driving medium and longer distances: it calculates the fastest route, takes traffic and route data into account, considers the driver’s driving style, calculates how long it will take to charge the vehicle, and includes it in the total driving time. Users are also shown basic information such as the charging power or charging connections and the plug type of the respective charging points. The system also shows whether charging stations are available or occupied. The Audi e-tron route planner gives preference to high-performance HPC charging stations (HPC = High Power Charging = ultra-fast charging) and, in the e-tron GT quattro models, activates battery preconditioning while driving. With an active e-tron route planner, the particular model always looks for the most efficient path to its destination. Additionally, the range calculator on the website shows the differences in range for the Audi e-tron and the Audi e-tron Sportback – depending on external temperature, driving mode, rim size, and use of heating and air conditioning.\n  Electric mobility in winter  Charging at low temperatures The intelligent battery management system (BMS) communicates with the charging point or wallbox to optimize power for the gentlest possible AC charging. Charging is regulated automatically and the system ends the charge as soon as the battery is full or a predefined charge level of, for example, 80 percent has been reached. During the charging process, the BMS monitors the voltages in the individual cells and balances them as needed. Additionally, intelligent management engages battery heating. If the battery temperature falls below a certain limit, the BMS automatically reduces charging capacity in order to prioritize early aging of the battery. In all, slow charging has a positive effect on the lifespan of the battery. Additionally, it is advisable to charge as soon as possible after driving when the outside temperature is cold. That is because the battery is still warmed up and recharges more gently and quickly.\nRange prognosis in the digital instrument panel The range prognosis is derived from the high-voltage battery’s charge level and the energy consumption forecast. This depends on several factors. Drive system consumption has the biggest effect on it. Convenience consumers and air conditioning have far less of an effect. For the projected range, Audi distinguishes between two scenarios: the active navigation route and inactive navigation. For the active navigation route, the projected consumption from the route profile (speed limits, green lights, differences in elevation) and current traffic information such as congestion as well as average energy consumption over the last 100 kilometers (62.1 miles). Additionally, anticipated convenience and climate consumption are assessed for the entire upcoming drive. When navigation is inactive, the average of the last 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) is applied to determine drive system consumption. Convenience and climate consumption are also assessed. By turning convenience consumers on and off via the range monitor, users can see their direct impact on the range prognosis.\nHigh-voltage battery maintenance Anyone who frequently makes short car trips should charge the battery to a maximum of 80 percent in order to save its capacity for longer ranges and to extend its lifespan. On the other hand, it is a good idea to avoid a long-lasting deep discharge when the charge level is below 20 percent. Anyone who frequently makes long car trips can charge up to 100 percent, but should then start driving immediately thereafter. Ideally, anyone who does not drive for longer than 12 hours should keep the charging level between 40 and 80 percent in the winter.\n  Electric mobility in winter  Geo-charging profile This automated function in the Audi e-tron records in the vehicle that drivers can activate or load previously configured charging profiles at particular locations. Once location-based charging settings are set in the MMI and saved with the help of GPS coordinates, the charging settings and the timeframe for the charging process can be configured. Users can set charging profiles for several addresses.\nPredictive preconditioning In order to be able to use the Audi e-tron GT’s high HPC charging capacity of up to 270 kW, the high-voltage battery needs to be at a particular temperature. This is achieved by means of adapted preconditioning of the battery while driving. When an HPC charging station is entered as the destination in the e-tron route planner, an algorithm calculates the anticipated arrival time and deduces the necessary heating or cooling capacity from that in order to be able to access high charging capacity at the charging station right away for short idle time. If the customer wishes, the interior temperature is also correspondingly regulated.\nReducing driving resistance and convenience consumers Smaller rim sizes, narrower tires, and the right air pressure can reduce the tires’ rolling resistance in the winter. By contrast, roof boxes increase aerodynamic drag. Inside the car, steering wheel and seat heating save energy because they operate close to the body and consume less electricity. Switching to air-circulation mode reduces loss of range.\n  Electric mobility in winter   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/thermalmanagementwinter/","title":"Intelligent thermal management in Audi models preserves range and performance","tags":[],"description":"In the winter, electrically powered cars have to bring the interior and the battery system to the right temperature. This double task already requires a lot of energy from them.","content":"  Audi Q4 e-tron charging in winter  Low exterior temperatures exacerbate the problem – and affect high-voltage batteries’ performance. Nonetheless, concern over excessive loss of range in electric Audi models is unfounded: with intelligent thermal management, the brand provides outstanding performance and range in its cars; special protective mechanisms ensure long battery life. In an interview, Pierre Woltmann, head of thermal management for high-voltage batteries at Audi, and Thomas Anzenberger from thermal management virtual functional development explain how the company with the four rings is effectively meeting the challenges of winter operation.\nDo drivers of electric Audi models need to be concerned about limitations in the winter? Thomas Anzenberger: I can answer that question with an unequivocal no. The size of our high-voltage batteries alone makes doubt about performance and range in the winter unwarranted. Our intelligent thermal management always selects the most efficient methods to heat the battery and the interior appropriately in the winter. As a result, high-voltage batteries have long lifespans, when our customers precondition for each season via what are known as AC charging stations or a home Wallbox. That function is particularly useful in the winter. It goes easy on the cells and simultaneously minimizes range loss because the battery is already in the optimal temperature range and therefore does not need to be heated as much.\n  Thomas Anzenberger  How does the cold affect a high-voltage battery? Pierre Woltmann: The performance of a high-voltage battery is fundamentally dependent on the charge level and the temperature. The colder it is, the less power the battery can provide. Electrochemical processes are a factor in this. At cold battery temperatures, the battery’s electric internal resistance increases and the usable capacity decreases. We protect the battery by releasing less amperage at a lower temperature. Additionally, the battery can absorb the waste heat from liquid-cooled high-voltage components like the power electronics, the drive system, and the charger and be heated directly by a cooling agent heater.\nWhat are the effects of cold on charging? Woltmann: Charging can take longer at low battery temperatures. For that reason, the battery has to be heated during charging, ideally even on the way to charging. Upon connecting with the charging point, the vehicle automatically communicates with the power source.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how the charging point knows how much electricity the battery can absorb at any time. So we ensure that the battery isn’t overloaded. When it’s charging, the battery draws the electricity it needs for heating power from the charging point.\n  Pierre Woltmann  What is the job of thermal management? Anzenberger: Basically, thermal management is responsible for distributing the heat flows between the drive system, the high-voltage battery, and the interior. Our heat pump system has acquitted itself well in this context above all. It converts energy from the powertrain or the surrounding air. That is heat that is available for the battery or, in the winter, for the interior as well. Using the surrounding air as an energy source is relatively new: we use it to balance the declining waste heat from the powertrain, which operates increasingly efficiently. That way, we have access to two mutually independent systems via the powertrain and the surrounding air, which we use to heat the interior and the high-voltage battery.\nHow is the temperature of the battery and the interior regulated while driving? Anzenberger: In order to ensure a reliable supply of heat even in very cold temperatures, our heat pump system, which is built into most of our electric models, integrates additional high-voltage heaters into the operating strategy. This ensures a comfortable interior even in extreme situations and quickly produces the ideal battery temperature of about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for maximum performance. A second electric heater is available in our winter package for the particularly cold northern countries. An additional heater for electric bicycles is also available as an option in some models.\nWoltmann: When our customers want to ride with maximum efficiency in cold exterior temperatures, the thermal management algorithm heats the battery to lower temperatures and, while it releases less driving power as a result, it also increases the vehicle’s range.\nWhat additional technical solutions has Audi developed to make the high-voltage battery independent of the effects of temperature? Woltmann: As a point of intersection with thermal management, we offer what is known as preconditioning, which has a positive effect on both the battery and the interior. It is possible to set the precise time of departure with the charging and departure timer – directly in the vehicle or with the myAudi app. As a result, the automatic charging process charges the battery to the preset level and a favorable temperature as close to the departure time as possible. This way, the loss of range is significantly reduced by heating the battery. In addition, preconditioning adjusts the temperature of the vehicle interior to the desired level prior to departure.\nAnzenberger: In the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT, conditioning for the charging process even functions automatically while driving in order to achieve consistently high charging capacity at fast-charging stations, namely when the e-tron route planner is used in these models. Depending on the outside air temperature, the intelligent thermal management system then additionally brings the battery to a temperature range that is optimal for charging while the car is driving and before charging starts, in addition to preconditioning.\nThis additional mobile preconditioning of the battery in the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT ensures the best and fastest possible charging results.\n  Audi RS e-tron GT \u0026 Audi Q4 e-tron  How does Audi reduce range loss by heating the interior? Woltmann: Compared with a combustion engine, an electric car has much less waste heat and energy available for heating. The heat that the battery, electric motor, and power electronics generate can be conducted into the interior with a heat pump. Basically, the heat pump works like a refrigerator – but in reverse. The more waste heat is available, the more efficiently the pump works. In the best case scenario, it can generate up to three kilowatts of heat output from one kilowatt of electrical energy. That technology is very useful particularly in the winter because it replaces a thermoelectric heating element. Depending on the external temperature, the heat pump can reach a higher range in comparison with conventional heating.\nWhat can customers who don’t have a garage available do? Woltmann : Anyone who needs more range as soon as they get into the car should precondition. Ideally, it should be done by AC charging, which is generally more efficient than DC charging because there is less power loss due to the lower currents. AC charging is also gentler because it doesn’t put as much strain on the battery. There is less amperage flowing with AC charging. The battery can absorb that even at very low battery temperatures, which means that the battery doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be heated as much. Charging should happen – regardless of whether it is AC or DC – immediately before starting a trip via the departure timer in order to use the higher battery temperature to gain range or immediately after driving in order to utilize the higher battery temperature to charge faster and more efficiently.\n  Audi Q4 e-tron  What happens to a cold battery at a fast-charging station? Woltmann: Regardless of the model, the algorithm in the vehicle recognizes when the car is being charged at a DC fast-charging station. The currents are released regardless of the charge level and temperature. With the active heating that we have implemented, we are significantly reducing the charging time in cold temperatures.\nWhen do high-voltage batteries reach their limit? Woltmann: To protect the battery, we don’t release any more electricity starting when the core temperature reaches minus 30 degrees (-22 Fahrenheit). But for that to happen, the car would have to be exposed to such an extreme temperature over a long period of time. Obviously it is also possible to drive an e-tron model with a sufficient charge level and a preheated high-voltage battery in external temperatures of minus 30 degrees.\nFrom a technical perspective, what additional advice can you give for the winter? Anzenberger: By using the car’s computer and the range monitor in the Audi MMI with range prediction while driving, customers can directly read how much range they are gaining when, for example, the interior temperature is reduced. The range can be increased with Range Mode. This slightly restricts comfort functions, drive power, and the maximum speed.\n  Range mode in Audi e-tron GT  Read more about thermal management You find details about thermal managment in our model section\n Thermal Management Audi e-tron GT / Audi RS e-tron GT Thermal management Audi Q4 e-tron Thermal management Audi e-tron   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/vorsprung2030/","title":"“Vorsprung 2030“ - Audi accelerating transformation","tags":[],"description":"Audi wants to be a sustainable, social, and technological leader by 2030.

The pace of change in our society is rapidly increasing. That’s why we\u0026rsquo;re accelerating our own transformation.” A few weeks ago, Audi announced that starting in 2026, it would only launch new models on the global market that are equipped with electric drive systems. The company will gradually phase out production of its internal combustion engines between now and 2033. This clear decision was the result of an intensive strategy process with the ambition to continue to grow profitably.\nIn order to continue living up to Audi’s “Vorsprung durch Technik” (“Progress through Technology”) slogan in the future, the Board of Management spent the past few months formulating the company’s new “Vorsprung 2030” strategy.With a firm date now set for the company’s transition to e-mobility, the brand with the four rings is resolutely tackling its transformation. Audi embraces its role as a pioneer and driver of innovation in the automotive industry. “‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ remains necessary because we can only solve many of the world’s major problems, such as carbon emissions and global warming, through the use of clean technologies. We view ourselves as a company that guarantees the freedom and individual mobility of our customers,” emphasized Duesmann. That is why Audi is focusing on zero-emission drive systems. “We don’t simply develop technology for its own sake. It must be consequential and effective in keeping the world moving.”\nSpeaking at the “Corporate \u0026amp; Business” theme day during the Audi Media Days event in the run-up to IAA 2021, the CEO will be taking questions from the international press on September 1, 2021, including: What is Audi’s vision? How will the company change in the coming months and years in order to continue to drive technological progress and position itself for the future? What is the company doing to implement additional internal processes that promote further innovation? And what innovations and products can customers look forward to in the coming years?\nDevelopment of the new “Vorsprung 2030” strategy “Vorsprung durch Technik” has defined Audi’s DNA for 50 years. To ensure that this doesn’t change, Audi’s chief strategist Silja Pieh and her team developed a new process for creating a sustainable and forward-looking corporate strategy. Together with around 500 Audi employees from across hierarchical levels and from major markets such as China and the United States, she spent months analyzing more than 600 global trends in the mobility sector through 2030 that could become relevant to the company. This resulted in strategic areas of activity which the team discussed and evaluated in depth together with the Board of Management. Some of the insights are obvious – sales and profits will gradually shift, for example, initially from vehicles with combustion engines to electric cars, and later, when autonomous driving offers additional growth potential, to software and services.\n  Audi charging hub  “One thing our entire team finds extremely encouraging is that many employees and the Board of Management are already deeply committed to the issue of sustainability. We want to further emphasize responsible business practices in the future and rigorously adhere to them,” explained Pieh. The new strategy focuses on profitable growth and differentiation – and provides guidelines for prioritizing strategic areas of activity. This involves a number of different components, such as employee training, the corporate culture, and a new corporate management system all working in tandem.\nIn addition to the plan to phase out the internal combustion engine, more strongly differentiating Audi’s all-electric vehicles from the competition through quality and design as well as increasing the added value for customers play an important role. This includes a seamless ecosystem for electric and autonomous driving. As of result of the changes, Audi will be in closer and more frequent contact with their customers in the future, with new digital and physical offerings,” says John Newman, head of digitalization at Audi.\nAudi will also more closely align business success with sustainable activities on the basis of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria include climate change mitigation and the protection of finite resources, occupational health and safety, social responsibility, and corporate governance practices related to compliance and risk management. Pieh points out that the strategy process isn’t finished, but is instead an ongoing development process: “The world and especially the transportation sector are rapidly evolving. We will respond to changes even more quickly and with greater flexibility in the future.” As part of the group’s integrated planning process, Audi will regularly analyze and, if necessary, refine its strategic framework.\nThe automaker wants to prove that it is indeed possible to reconcile premium individual mobility and an uncompromising commitment to sustainability. Together with the Volkswagen Group and its other brands, Audi intends to play a leading role in the new mobility world. In its transformation toward e-mobility and software, the group’s concentrated creative power represents a decisive competitive advantage. In July, the Volkswagen Group redefined its priorities with its NEW AUTO strategy, which clearly supports the successful implementation of “Vorsprung 2030.”\nMartin Primus, General Secretary of AUDI AG, believes the advantage of this strategic vision is that it allows all of the company’s employees to focus on the upcoming challenges – both within the brand and across the entire brand group with Bentley, Lamborghini, Ducati, and Italdesign. Setting this course early on gives the Audi team the necessary clarity and sufficient time to complete the transformation. A restructured, strong foundation will facilitate its implementation financially, organizationally, and in terms of human resources.\nNew ideas for the future – innovations at Audi Audi space frame, quattro, matrix LED headlights, and numerous patents related to e-mobility – the list of Audi innovations is long, and will become even longer in the future. Oliver Hoffmann, Member of the Board of Management for Technical Development at Audi, knows that the coming years will bring further highlights. “In the age of new mobility, we not only define “Vorsprung” as world-class engineering, state-of-the-art design, and a captivating digital experience. We don’t just think in terms of vehicles. In the future, the focus will increasingly be on holistic mobility solutions, including the surrounding infrastructure,” he explained.\nThrough the “Audi DNA” project, the new Head of Development intends to place a strong focus on innovations that customers can experience. In this context, the company is taking a deep dive into technical details such as steering angle requirements, hand torque, and acoustics in order to develop a one-of-a-kind Audi feel for its customers. “We need to give our products a clear, unmistakable DNA. In the future, we will be very explicit in our definition of what driving an Audi should feel like. This also applies to highly automated driving, by the way,” Hoffmann noted.\nLike the entire company, Technical Development is undergoing the greatest transformation in its history – the most challenging decade in the automotive industry lies ahead. This includes the steadily increasing focus on software in the vehicles and autonomous driving. Alongside e-mobility, focal points of the Volkswagen Group’s strategy include enhancing connectivity, digital services, and expanding the use of internally programmed systems.\nIn the future, customers will be able to upgrade their vehicles and update or install subsystems as needed. Owners of vehicles with combustion engines in various countries will also receive exceptional service over their entire life cycle. “Our vehicles will be even more customer-centric, individualized, and sustainable thanks to intelligent hardware offered through our after-sales business,” said Hoffmann, explaining the decision.\nIn the new 2030 strategy, CARIAD plays an important role. The group’s software arm will develop a scalable software platform with a standardized operating system and cloud connectivity for all Volkswagen Group brands by 2025. “The E3 2.0 software platform will serve as the enabler of the synergies and innovations of the future, including autonomous driving,” explained Duesmann. While CARIAD is responsible for the technical implementation of software-based solutions, integrating them into the vehicle will be carried out by the respective brands in coordination with CARIAD.\nJürgen Rittersberger, Member of the Board of Management for Finance and Legal Affairs, explained at the Audi Media Days event just how he intends to lay the financial foundation to drive innovation within the Audi Group. “Here at Audi, there’s a specific mindset behind each and every technical innovation: we want to think holistically and always keep the societal and social context in mind.” To ensure that innovations remain affordable, the company continues to optimize its processes and costs. “In order to tackle a transformation such as the one Audi is currently undergoing, we must and indeed will free up the appropriate financial resources. This is the only way to ensure that we remain competitive and viable over the long term,” declared Rittersberger. In addition to results-driven volume management and strong operating performance, leveraging hardware and software synergies within the Volkswagen Group plays a key role in the company’s success. The first half of 2021 has shown that Audi is on the right track – a record number of vehicles shipped and significant volume growth in battery-electric vehicles prove that the brand with the four rings is committed to sustainable and profitable mobility.\nThrough its Berlin-based innovation unit Denkwerkstatt, Audi has been developing new ideas for the future for around five years. In the meantime, Audi Denkwerkstatt is widely recognized as one of the leading innovation units operated by a German company, and with its start-up atmosphere, is a “speedboat” used by Audi to develop innovative business models in agile teams. In addition, Audi’s intrapreneurship program sees employees from various divisions develop business ideas in just a few weeks. At the end of each stage, a jury of experts evaluates whether a project should be continued or stopped on the basis of predefined criteria. “Our goal is to quickly transform new ideas into customer-relevant innovations. Audi Denkwerkstatt plays a major role in this process,” emphasized Hoffmann.\nAt the same time, Audi is aggressively working on efficient manufacturing processes and smart technologies in production. In the Audi Production Lab, for example, the company is driving the development of cutting-edge manufacturing solutions. To this end, the team draws on a network of institutes, start-ups, and global suppliers – and above all else, relies on the expertise and creativity of its employees. Meanwhile, the Audi site in Neckarsulm plays a pivotal role as a pilot factory and real-world laboratory for the digital transformation. IT solutions and input from technology partners such as Amazon Web Services, SAP, and Capgemini are being incorporated into the Industry 4.0 project to create a fully connected factory here.\nAudi in China The Chinese market will continue to play an important role in the company’s new strategic alignment. Audi estimates that the market for premium vehicles here will grow to 4.5 million units annually by 2030 – in 2020, this figure stood at 3.1 million vehicles. Furthermore, electric vehicles’ share of this total could increase from 10 percent today to as much as 40 percent by the end of the decade.\nAs such, it is only logical for Audi to continue expanding its business in China. This includes increasing the supply of electric cars produced locally. Through its activities, Audi is helping drive the Chinese automotive industry’s shift toward sustainable mobility. The headquarters of the joint venture between FAW and Volkswagen is located in Changchun, where Audi has been manufacturing automobiles for over 30 years – in addition to other locations in China. Together with FAW, the company will expand its locally produced product range to twelve models by the end of 2021. The first products from the collaboration with Audi’s second Chinese partner SAIC Volkswagen will be launched in 2022. These will also be sold through the existing dealer investor network operated by FAW-Volkswagen Audi.\n“Our approach here is based on the idea of ‘In China for China’, and as such, Audi is focusing on the specific needs of customers in the world’s largest automotive market and actively driving innovation,” said Werner Eichhorn, president of Audi China. “Together with our two partners FAW and SAIC, we are well prepared for the challenges of the future.” To date, Audi has shipped a total of more than 7 million vehicles in the Chinese market, selling 727,358 vehicles in China in 2020 alone. In the first half of 2021, this figure stood at 418,749 vehicles.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audigrandsphereconcept/","title":"Audi grandsphere concept - First class toward the future","tags":[],"description":"The private jet for the road – At the IAA 2021, Audi is presenting the Audi grandsphere concept study. Like a first class flight, the 5.35 m (17.6 ft.) long grandsphere sedan combines the luxury of private travel in the greatest of comfort with a comprehensive onboard experience offering.","content":"  Audi grandsphere concept  Level 4 automated driving makes new dimensions of freedom possible: in this mode, the interior turns into a spacious sphere of experience without a steering wheel, pedals, or displays. And the front seats become a first class lounge with maximum space, freer views, and access to all the functions of a holistic digital ecosystem that the Audi grandsphere is integrated into.\nAs the second of three “sphere” concept cars from the brand with the four rings, the Audi grandsphere has a special place. That is because the technologies and design features assembled in it will turn up again within a few years in future Audi series. The Audi grandsphere concept illustrates the brand’s claim that it is becoming the trendsetter at the top of the automotive industry for technological transformation and completely new, holistic mobility offerings.\nThe electrically driven roadster Audi skysphere concept debuted in August 2021 – it was a spectacular vision of an automatically driving GT that transforms into a self-driving sports car with a variable wheelbase. These two concept cars – as well as the Audi urbansphere, which will appear as the third part of the trio in 2022 – are linked by their overall concept, which is derived from their ability to drive automatically at level 4. Audi is working with CARIAD, the Volkswagen Group’s software think tank, toward introducing that technology in the second half of the decade.\nLevel 4: not only does it change the interior space of the traditional driver-oriented cockpit and passenger seats into a spacious lounge as soon as the steering wheel and pedals are reduced. At the same time, it opens up new levels of freedom for all the passengers. That is because the Audi grandsphere not only frees the driver from the tasks of driving whenever possible, but at the same time also offers everyone onboard a wide range of options to use that freedom for individually variable experiences: communication or relaxation, work or withdrawal into a private sphere as desired. The Audi grandsphere concept transforms from being strictly an automobile in an “experience device.“\nThanks to Audi’s own services and the ability to integrate digital services, the possibilities are nearly endless. These can be used to access a variety of service options related to the current trip – such as designing a spectacular scenic route, as well as restaurant or hotel options. The vehicle also takes care of everyday tasks that go beyond the ride itself. For example, the autonomous Audi grandsphere concept picks up its passengers with information about their current destination and independently handles parking and charging.\nCustomized infotainment options are also available, such as seamless integration of onboard streaming from music and video providers that have been used previously. In an additional step, Audi will keep personalized and exclusive options available in the future – concerts, cultural events, or even sporting events that customers are invited to.\nThe Audi grandsphere concept illustrates the brand’s claim that it defines the progressive luxury of the future: for Audi, that includes the option of new high-class experiences, enabled by digitalization, as well as a holistic approach to sustainability with the goal of carbon neutrality in the near future along the entire value chain.\nFirst class for the future times three Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and Audi urbansphere are the three concept cars that the brand with the four rings is using to showcase its vision of progressive luxury. In the process, Audi is creating a vehicle experience that goes far beyond the purpose of merely spending time in a car to get from point A to point B, and even far beyond the driving experience itself.\nThese concept cars feature a new design that ultimately reimagines the interior, the passenger compartment, as the center of the vehicle and no longer subordinates the passenger experience to the requirements of the technology. This is reflected in the variable layout of the interior, the disappearance of the controls, and the sheer expanse of the cabin, in addition to linking them to new service offerings.\nThe design process – from the inside out Even the “sphere” in the name sends a signal: the heart of the Audi skysphere, grandsphere, and urbansphere concept vehicles is always the interior. The drive system and the handling are no longer at the top of the design specifications in this new generation of cars. Instead, the starting point is the interior, the occupants’ living and experience sphere while traveling. Their needs and desires shape the space, the architecture, and the functions. With that reassessment, the design process itself changes. At the beginning of all discussions, the focus is directed toward the interior and its design. Only after that do we design the package, exterior lines, and proportions that shape the car into a total work of art, along with the technological premises.\nSpace, form, function – the interior   Audi grandsphere doors  The doors of the Audi grandsphere concept are reversed so front and back touch; there is no B-pillar. The whole world of the interior opens up to passengers as soon as they climb in. But even before that, the Audi grandsphere has identified its passengers with a pathway identification – an innovative feature – that opens the doors and welcomes them with individually staged displays and ambient light. The driver and passenger positions are automatically detected and an array of personal comfort features – such as the climate control settings and the seats – are adjusted for the individual seats. At the same time, the infotainment system accesses the passengers’ most recently used services and seamlessly resumes them inside the car. For instance, a video that a passenger was streaming on a tablet is automatically played back over the display surface in the Audi grandsphere. On the driver\u0026rsquo;s side, on the other hand, the projection surface automatically picks up on displaying the news the occupant was reading before getting in.\nIn the interior, the lines on the decorative surfaces and functional elements are emphatically horizontal. The open, broad interior supports the impression of a unique space and the lack of a steering wheel, pedals, or conventional dashboard create a feeling of openness and breadth.\nThe large glass surfaces, expansive windshield, and transparent ceiling also emphasize that feeling. The same goes for the particular geometry of the side windows: their upper half is distinctively angled – the widest part is just slightly above eye level. It is a trick that Audi demonstrated for the first time in 2017 with its futuristic AI:CON concept car and which is now moving toward series production.\nThe change in the comfort zone is radical: if the boss’ seat is in the back in a conventional sedan, first class has now shifted forward into the front row. That is because it is no longer necessarily subordinated, first and foremost, to the driving function and the controls. In level 4 driving, the steering wheel and pedals disappear and the front area of the cabin becomes actual free space in all its breadth, with a perfect view through the large front and side windows, as well as maximum possibilities for movement.\n  Audi grandsphere doors  The interior appears particularly wide when the two individual front seats are pushed all the way back. The Audi grandsphere is a 2+2-seater. An upholstered, two-person bench with an armrest that goes around the side is integrated as a seating option in the back, while both front seats are designed for first class comfort and space.\nThe seating surfaces and backs of the two seats with integrated belts are visually separate. The side bolsters of the seat backs are discreetly bent, thereby ensuring support while driving through curves. The possible seat positions are optimized for every use: in the upright position, the Audi grandsphere can be perfectly ergonomically controlled – as desired and outside level 4 zones. With the back tilted 40 degrees, passengers can relax and use the infotainment system. Finally, if the back is folded out to 60 degrees, it achieves a perfect resting position. The headrest can be bent 15 degrees forward. Outlets for air that is filtered and temperature controlled – even scented, as desired – as well as speakers that are inaudible to other passengers and allow for a private aural zone are all integrated into this area.\n  Audi grandsphere concept  Between the front seats – normally concealed under metallic trim – there is a compact, onboard cooler with two glasses and a designed, elegant bottle for soft drinks. This is another sign of the Audi grandsphere concept’s first class claim.\nNo fittings, no screens: displays and operation One surprise when looking around in the Audi grandsphere\u0026rsquo;s natural-colored, reduced-design interior: neither batteries of dial instruments nor black screens for virtual display concepts are visible before activating the driving functions – the oft-cited digital detox at its finest.\nInstead, there are clearly articulated and sedate areas with materials of the highest quality. Wood and wool, synthetic textile fabrics and metal are visible and pleasant to touch as wall cladding, seat covering, and carpeting. Many of these materials, like the hornbeam veneers, come from sustainable cultivation or are made from recycled raw materials. There is no leather in the Audi grandsphere – even this is in keeping with a progressive understanding of luxury, which is always inseparable from sustainability.\n  Audi grandsphere concept  Another surprise whenever the vehicle comes to life at the touch of a fingertip: there are displays – but they take the form of projections on the wooden surfaces under the windshield. Depending on the driving status – whether manual with a steering wheel or level 4 – they are either distributed across the entire width of the interior or segmented for the driver and front seat passenger. All the information that is necessary while traveling is there in high resolution and precisely readable.\nAlternatively, the projection surfaces can also be used – in automated driving mode – as CinemaScope screens for infotainment content or even as screens for video conferences. In addition, a sensor bar is integrated under the projection surfaces for quick switching between content – for instance, for music or navigation. It shows all the functions and applications that are active in the car. Icons flash for the different menus.\nOne particular, extremely innovative control element is located near the door cut-out on the interior cladding: the MMI touchless response. If the driver is sitting in the active position behind the steering wheel, far toward the front in the interior, he or she can use that control to haptically select various function menus via a rotary ring and buttons and click through the different levels. A simple, intuitive operation.\nIf, on the other hand, the driver reclines the seat far to the back during level 4 driving, he or she does not have to do without these comfort items. That is because, at that point, a combination of eye tracking and gesture control are used. A sensor directed at the eye detects the line of sight when the control unit is to be engaged. And the passenger only needs to make analogous hand motions – without leaning over – that are similar to haptic operation and can use the system just as well that way – without touching a thing.\nWhether it is eye tracking, gesture or voice control, handwritten input, or touch, the same thing applies to all operation modes: the Audi grandsphere concept adjusts to the individual user and learns his or her preferences and frequently used menus – and on that basis it can not only sensibly complete rudimentary commands, but also give personal proposals directly to the user.\nControl panels are even integrated into the armrests on the doors. That way, the car always offers passengers invisible touch surfaces using an optic indicator to show its position. At the same time, there are VR glasses in the armrests on the left and right doors that can be used in conjunction with infotainment options – for instance for the holoride system.\nDynamic monolith – the exterior design At 5.35 m (17.6 ft.) long, 2 m (6.6 ft.) wide, and 1.39 m (4.6 ft.) high, the Audi grandsphere concept’s measurements reveal this sedan as an unambiguous example of the luxury class automobile. The 3.19 m (10.5 ft.) wheelbase indicates top value, which even overshadows the long version of the current Audi A8. But even more striking than what these figures suggest is the visual impression that it makes upon seeing it for the first time. That is because the Audi grandsphere looks nothing like a traditional sedan, but rather more like a tightly drawn four-door GT with a line the comes straight from the wind tunnel. And it does that while doing without any decor or superfluous flourishes.\nIn the process, the Audi grandsphere consistently implements the specific conditions of the electric drive system right in the front end – a short overhang, a flat hood, and the windshield that projects far forward as the foremost limit of the large interior. Nonetheless, unlike many electric cars, it does not look futuristic at all, but rather emphasizes traditional beauty ideals. The top edge of the hood is drawn far into the side of the chassis in a horizontal line, suggesting a long engine compartment – all characteristics of a GT. In the rear, that line continues at the same height across the rear wheel well, encompassing the whole cabin and emphasizing its size.\nA second horizontal line emanates from the bottom edge of the hood and runs under the side windows and likewise around the entire cabin. This subdivides the door surfaces into horizontally oriented shoulders and the convex verticals below them above the rocker panel. The wheel wells have a soft, yet distinctive shape – typical Audi. The slender rear behind the massive C-pillar is a quote from traditional streamlining. And the dynamically sloping arc of the roofline reveals the grandsphere as part of the Audi Sportback tradition. All lines and all surfaces seem to organically correlate, combining to form one monolithic body.\nAt 23 inches, the wheels of the Audi grandsphere concept quote an icon from the 1990s – the Audi Avus. At the same time, the six double spokes signal light construction and stability, recalling functional motorsport wheels and the Bauhaus tradition in brand design.\nVisible technology – light In the front end, there is an innovative interpretation of the Singleframe that defines Audi’s look: it is shaped like a flat hexagon. The interior surfaces, behind a transparent covering, are indirectly lit from above while driving – a distinctive, extremely three-dimensionally structured visual effect.\nThe headlight units on the upper side of the Singleframe look narrow, like focused eyes. The lighting units reference the four rings brand logo: they enlarge and isolate the intersection of two rings into a pupil – a new, unmistakable digital light signature. This means that the size of the light areas can be adjusted according to their function as daytime running lights or as dynamically staged blinkers – depending on the traffic situation – and thereby issue an obvious signal in the interest of safety. The same graphic is also in the rear lighting units – another significant characteristic of the Audi light design.\n  Audi grandsphere concept  Drive system and charging The technology platform of the Audi grandsphere – what is known as the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE – was conceived exclusively for battery-powered electric drive systems and therefore it takes full advantage of that technology. The key element of PPE is a battery module between the axles that holds around 120 kWh of energy in the grandsphere concept. A flat battery layout is possible because Audi uses the entire vehicle base between the axes.\nTogether with the large wheels, this produces basic proportions that are perfect not only from a design perspective. The core benefits include a long interior and therefore legroom in both rows of seats. Additionally, the absence of a gearbox cover and a cardan tunnel increases spatial comfort in electric cars.\nNonetheless, the Audi grandsphere does not forego the quattro drive system, which is essential to the brand. That is because the concept car has separate electric motors mounted on the front and rear axles that use electronic coordination to deliver all-wheel drive on demand and execute a perfect balance between driving dynamics and energy efficiency. The Audi grandsphere concept’s two electric motors are capable of delivering a total output of 530 kW and a torque of 960 Newton meters.\nFast charging, high range The heart of the drive system is the 800 volt charging technology. Like the Audi e-tron GT before it, this technology ensures that the battery can be charged with up to 270 kW in a very short time at fast-charging stations.\n  Audi grandsphere concept with fast charging  This strategy makes charging times that approach a refueling stop for a car with a conventional engine possible. Just ten minutes are enough to charge the battery to a level sufficient to power the car more than 300 kilometers (186 miles). In less than 25 minutes, you can charge the 120 kWh battery from 5 to 80 percent.\nTogether with a range of more than 750 kilometers (466 miles) – depending on the selected drive system and power output – the Audi grandsphere concept is unconditionally suitable for long distances. Furthermore, its range and charging speed keep pace with those of combustion engines, making it the perfect universal car for everyday needs.\nIn terms of dynamic qualities, the Audi grandsphere concept – as is typical for an electric car – truly outshines its rivals with combustion engines. Thanks to the high torque that is available from the first revolution, acceleration from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) takes just over four seconds; maximum speed is limited in the interest of increased range.\nAir suspension and active suspension for maximum comfort The front wheels are connected via a five-link axle, specially optimized for electric vehicles. In the rear, there is a multi-link axle that, like the front, is made of aluminum. Despite the long wheelbase, the steerable rear wheels provide excellent maneuverability. The luxurious Audi grandsphere concept touring sedan utilizes Audi air suspension – a single chamber system with adaptive dampers. Quite well suited for dynamic driving when necessary it guarantees gentle comfort without noticeable vehicle body movements, under normal conditions.\nThe reason: the Audi grandsphere concept has active suspension. The high-tech system can separately pull up or push down on each wheel separately in milliseconds via electromechanical actuators. That makes it possible to actively control the state of the chassis in every driving situation and therefore significantly reduce pitching and plunging when accelerating or braking. Thanks to the front camera, which recognizes unevenness, the adjustments happen predictively. The navigation system’s topographical data are also used to integrate curve radii, gradients, and inclines into the system’s projection.\n   "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audiskysphereconcept/","title":"Audi skysphere concept – the future is wide open","tags":[],"description":"Audi has unveiled the first member of a new family of concept vehicles, a spectacular roadster. Audi skysphere concept is the name of the electric-powered, two-door convertible whose lines lead directly to the Audi design of tomorrow.","content":"  Audi skysphere concept  With it, the brand is illustrating its vision for the progressive luxury segment of the future, in which the interior becomes an interactive space and the vehicle a platform for captivating experiences. This is being made possible thanks to autonomous driving, a revolutionary redesign of the interior, and a seamless digital ecosystem.\nThe Audi skysphere concept shows how the brand is redefining luxury in the future – it’s no longer just about driving. The concept car was designed with the clear objective of offering its occupants captivating and world-class experiences.\nTo give passengers the maximum amount of freedom, the Audi skysphere concept was designed for two different driving experiences: a grand touring experience and a sports experience. This makes use of a spectacular technical detail – the variable wheelbase. Electric motors and a sophisticated mechanism with body and frame components that slide into one another make it possible to vary the wheelbase itself and the exterior length of the car by 250 millimeters. At the same time, the vehicle’s ground clearance is adjusted by 10 millimeters to enhance comfort and driving dynamics.\n  Audi skysphere concept sport mode  With the touch of button, the driver can take advantage of their freedom and choose their own driving experience– either they pilot their 4.94-meter-long e-roadster themselves in “Sports” mode with a reduced wheelbase, while the rear-wheel steering ensures that the vehicle remains extremely agile despite its dimensions. Or they can choose to be chauffeured around in a 5.19-meter GT in the autonomous “Grand Touring” driving mode while enjoying the sky and the scenery, maximum legroom, and the services offered by a seamlessly integrated digital ecosystem.\n  Audi skysphere concept Grand Touring mode  In this mode, the steering wheel and pedals move into an invisible area; the feeling of space in the concept car opens up completely new realms of possibility for such a sporty convertible. Meanwhile, the Audi skysphere automatically keeps an eye on the road and traffic with its sensor system and drives the occupants safely to their destination.\nSimilar to how the interior design offers a new, contemporary interpretation of luxury, digitization and the ecosystem open up unprecedented levels of freedom and worlds of experience for the vehicle’s passengers. Thanks to Audi’s own services and the ability to integrate digital services, the possibilities are nearly endless. In addition, the passengers can share their experience on the road with friends via social media, with images of the interior and the surrounding area. The vehicle also takes care of everyday tasks that go beyond the ride itself. For example, the autonomous Audi skysphere concept picks up its passengers with information about their current destination and independently handles parking and charging.\nAudi skysphere to be unveiled on its home turf in California The Audi skysphere concept will make its public debut on August 13, 2021, as part of Monterey Car Week – on the legendary fairways of the Pebble Beach golf course. This means the vehicle’s unveiling in California is taking place more or less on its home turf. This is because the concept car was conceived and designed at the Audi Design Studio in Malibu, just a stone’s throw away from the Pacific Coast Highway, the legendary coastal road that connects the suburbs of Los Angeles with northern California. Studio manager Gael Buzyn and his team are the creative minds behind the project. A legendary classic model from the company’s own history – the Horch 853 roadster – served as the inspiration for the new groundbreaking model. The impressive convertible, which is also around 5.20 meters in length, was not only the definition of modern luxury in the 1930s, but also won the Concours d’Elegance in Pebble Beach in 2009.\nBut the visual inspiration from its predecessor is limited to the concept car’s dimensions and typical proportions with a rather compact cabin and long front end. A look under the hood of the Horch reveals an imposing straight-eight engine with a displacement of 5 liters. The Audi skysphere, on the other hand, mainly has electric drive components between the front axle and the windshield, such as the charger and the DC/DC converter, plus the actuators and electronic and mechanical components for the adaptive wheelbase. It also features a spacious trunk filled with two golf bags specially designed for the concept car.\nThe drive system: 465 kW of power “New technologies like electrification, digitalization, and autonomous driving gave us the opportunity to create an experience that goes way beyond the one that typical roadsters offer today,” said design project manager Gael Buzyn.\nAn electric motor positioned on the powered rear axle is responsible for delivering power to the wheels of the Audi skysphere. A total of 465 kilowatts of power and 750 Newton meters of torque have an easy time with the roadster, which only weighs around 1,800 kilograms. The weight distribution of around 60 percent on the powered rear axle results in ample traction and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just four seconds, if required.\nThe Audi skysphere’s battery modules are primarily positioned behind the cabin – an ideal configuration for the vehicle’s center of gravity and agility. Further modules can be found between the seats in the center tunnel of the skysphere interior – another position chosen in favor of vehicle dynamics. The battery’s capacity is expected to be more than 80 kWh, giving the car a range of more than 500 kilometers according to the WLTP standard, at least in the economical GT mode.\nThe chassis: rear-wheel steering and adaptive air suspension The vehicle features double wishbone axles in the front and the rear. The upper and lower wishbones are forged or cast from aluminum. Steering takes place via a steer-by-wire system that controls both the front and the rear wheels. Because the system is not mechanically connected to the front axle, the driver can select different steering ratios and steering settings – all at the touch of a button. This allows the steering to be adjusted from extremely direct to comfortable, but also from high self-aligning forces to minimal self-aligning forces, for example when parking. The rear-axle steering and adaptive wheelbase also contribute to the car’s small turning radius.\n  Audi skysphere concept  A long-established Audi chassis technology ensures that the suspension delivers the necessary level of versatility – the latest evolutionary stage of Audi’s adaptive air suspension has been implemented in the concept car and features three independent air chambers to provide a comfortable base suspension. Individual chambers can be deactivated for a more sporty ride with fast acceleration. The result is that the characteristic curve of the spring becomes more progressive, reducing roll and pitch to a minimum. Lowering the body by 10 mm reduces aerodynamic drag – particularly relevant when driving long distances. The Audi skysphere’s active suspension plays a key role in the versatility of the car’s handling characteristics. When simply coasting along, the individual wheels are selectively raised or lowered to compensate for unevenness and undulations in the road surface – the result of a symbiosis between the navigation system’s digital predictions and the active chassis’ sophisticated control and actuation systems. Mounted on aerodynamically styled 23-inch alloy rims, the 285/30 tires strike a perfect balance between suitability for long-distance trips thanks to minimal rolling resistance and a sporty, active driving style with high longitudinal and lateral acceleration.\nThe exterior: reverence without retro When it comes to their footprint – 5.23 meters in length versus 5.19; a width of 1.85 versus 2.00 meters – it is easy to see the similarity between the legendary Horch 853 convertible and the Audi skysphere. A striking difference, on the other hand, can be found in their height – the legendary Horch, with its iconic design, towered up to 1.77 meters depending on the body shape, while its autonomous descendant, the Audi skysphere, ducks down to the road in Sport mode at 1.23 meters flat, with an optimized center of gravity and aerodynamics. The concept car pays its respects to the classic model without merely remaining a retro imitation.\nAfter all, apart from its dimensions, it’s the lines that make a real difference. With its wide curved and flared wheel arches typical of the brand, the skysphere emphasizes the wide track – a visible indication of its dynamic talents. Viewed from the side, the proportions are impressive with a long hood and – especially at the front – a short overhang. The surfaces of the wheel arches and front hood are organically curved. The rear end was developed in a wind tunnel and combines elements of a speedster and a shooting brake with large glass surfaces in a traditional streamlined design. Two overnight bags designed specifically for the Audi skysphere find space under the glass, and are held in place with straps that are stretched in a crosswise pattern.\nThe front end – although no longer serving as a radiator grill – clearly features the brand’s typical Singleframe and the three-dimensionally designed, illuminated emblem with the four rings. The entire Singleframe and also the adjacent surfaces on the sides are designed with white LED elements to literally act as a stage for visual effects – both functional effects as well as moving welcome sequences when the vehicle is opened and closed.\nGentle dimming and a structured, rhythmically pulsating light produce an elegant effect. The daytime running lights in the side front sections, in turn, give the lighting units a resolute, focused “gaze.” If the wheelbase is changed, the LEDs in the front and rear display a specially composed dynamic sequence.\nThe rear end is also dominated by a digitally controlled LED surface that extends across the entire width of the vehicle. Countless red LEDs are scattered like rubies across the vertical rear surface. Reflections create dynamic lighting and shadow effects when the lighting units are switched on and off.\n  Audi skysphere concept  Upon changing the wheelbase and thus the operating mode from GT to Sport, the light signature also changes and sends a clear indication of the changed character of the Audi skysphere concept, particularly in the area around the Singleframe.\nA characteristic feature of the side view are the rocker panels, which seem to protrude into the rear wheel arch – a necessary feature when varying the wheelbase actually pushes it backwards. The rocker panel is attached to the front end of the car, and as it moves, the panel also slides to the rear under the fixed door. In the process, the wheelbase is reduced from the standard size of an A8 L to the significantly more compact size of the curve-compatible Audi RS 5 – 25 centimeters make all the difference. And not just technically, but also visually and, above all, in terms of the driving experience.\nThere’s no doubt that the Audi skysphere concept has two personalities – a GT and a luxury sports car. The key differences, however, can only be enjoyed in the interior, because here, behind the rear-hinged and wide-opening doors, the Audi skysphere offers highly contrasting experiences.\nThe interior: two spheres of experience in one When it comes to the three upcoming concept cars Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and Audi urbansphere, the brand is placing the space that surrounds the passengers (“sphere”) and which becomes an experience for them – the interior – at the center of its designs. This is because all three vehicles are designed for level 4 autonomous driving – meaning that in certain defined road and traffic situations, the driver can delegate complete responsibility to the car and no longer has to intervene.\nAs a result, control elements such as the steering wheel and pedals can be swiveled into an invisible position and thereby completely removed from the interior. And passengers, including the one in the front left seat, can enjoy a new form of freedom – the freedom to relax in the open air, enjoy the scenery and the wind, or interact with the Internet and the world thanks to the connection with the digital ecosystem in the Audi skysphere.\n  Audi skysphere concept  Free of controls, the interior appears as a light, spacious environment, inspired in many areas by the Art Deco universe. The comfortable seats boast the visual elegance of designer furnishings, yet they fulfill the functions of an car seat in driving mode without any compromises – side support and safety features are part of the package. They are upholstered in sustainably produced microfiber fabric and, thanks to their variable position in the interior, offer the kind of freedom to move and legroom that can otherwise only be experienced when flying first class on an airplane. Environmentally certified eucalyptus wood and synthetically produced imitation leather are other sustainably manufactured materials that contribute to creating an unparalleled experience in the vehicle’s interior.\nShould the Audi skysphere concept be used in driver-operated mode, then the interior transforms into an ergonomically perfect driving machine cockpit. Together with the chassis and body, the instrument panel and the monitor panel on the center console also move to the rear. The driver finds all the controls, including the steering wheel and pedals, in the position that best suits them.\nLarge touch monitor surfaces – 1415 mm wide, 180 mm high – on the dashboard and in the upper area of the center console are used to operate the vehicle and infotainment systems. In Grand Touring mode, this can be used to display content from the Internet, video conferences, or streamed movies. Small touch panels in the doors are used to operate the air conditioning.\nA high-quality sound system – befitting of this luxury convertible – delivers concert hall audio quality even when the vehicle is in motion. The speakers are hidden behind the door panels; a few more in the rear interior wall even produce surround sound. The shape of the headrests prevents turbulence and also annoying wind noise.\nThe vehicle experience: luxury without limits Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and, coming in 2022, Audi urbansphere are the three concept cars that the brand with the four rings is using to showcase its vision of progressive luxury. In the process, Audi is creating a vehicle experience that goes far beyond the purpose of merely spending time in a car to get from point A to point B, and even far beyond the driving experience itself.\nThese concept cars feature a new design that ultimately reimagines the interior, the passenger compartment, as the center of the vehicle and no longer subordinates the passenger experience to the requirements of the technology. This is reflected in the variable layout of the interior, the disappearance of the controls, and the sheer expanse of the cabin. In Grand Touring mode, this not only allows both passengers to enjoy a smooth and pleasant journey, but also combines it with new service offerings. These can be used to access a variety of service options related to the current trip – such as designing a spectacular scenic route, as well as restaurant or hotel options.\nCustomized infotainment options are also available, such as linking the on-board streaming service to music and video providers used at home. And in a further step, Audi also aims to provide personalized and exclusive options for users of its luxury cars in the future – such as concerts, cultural events, or even sporting events that are only available upon special invitation. In this way, a vehicle like the Audi skysphere concept will become a platform for experiences that expand horizons beyond the mere ride in just a few years.\n "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/_header/","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"docs "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/about/","title":"About electrichasgoneaudi.net","tags":[],"description":"The goal for Electrichasgoneaudi.net is to be the ultimate site for information about all-electric Audis.","content":"The target audience is everyone owning, everyone considering buying, and everyone wanting to learn about all-electric Audis\nThe site is community-driven and open source, meaning the content is managed by owners and can be updated by anyone having a Github account.\nWhat type of content do you find?
