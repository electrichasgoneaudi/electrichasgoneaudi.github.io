In addition, people might be willing to increase/reduce their budget depending on the value of money and features.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we in this article will go into the detailed difference between the Audi e-tron 55 quattro and the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro\nAudi e-tron 55 quattro and Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro Introduction Audi e-tron 55 was presented in September 2018 and is Audi’s first all-electric model. The MLB-Evo platform is the basis for this model. Traditional models also use this platform.\nIn April 2021, Audi presented the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 as the first mid-size SUV.\nA dedicated EV platform, called MEB, is used on this model. This platform was created by Volkswagen and used by several models.\nConsumption According to the specification, the consumption is 25% higher on Audi e-tron 55 compared to Audi 40 e-tron 50. In reality, you can see up to 35% difference in consumption. The main reasons for this are smaller tires on the Q4 e-tron 50, more efficient motors, less weight, and a smaller size that causes less aerodynamical drag.\nRange Because of the low consumption, the Q4 e-tron 50 has a better range even though the battery is 12% smaller. As a result, the range difference would, in most driving conditions, be 10-15% better on the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 compared to a similar equipped Audi e-tron 55.\nIn the real world, depending on weather and driving style, the range on the Audi e-tron 55 would be between 250-450km, while on the Audi Q4 e-tron, the range would be 300-500km in similar conditions.\nPerformance The Audi e-tron 55 has 408 hp, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 299 hp. For the Q4 e-tron 50 quattro, the full power is only available when fully charged and above 23 degrees, while the full power is available in much larger areas for the Audi e-tron. However, since the weight is lower on the Q4 e-tron, the difference feels smaller and is probably small enough not to make it the deciding factor between the models for many.\nSuspension Adaptive air suspension with electronic damping control is standard equipment on the Audi e-tron. Depending on the speed and the driver’s preferences, it individually adjusts the ride height according to the road conditions. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load.\nAud Q4 e-tron is only available with standard suspension.\nFor many, this is a deciding factor.\nSize The Audi e-tron is 313 mm longer and 81 mm wider than Q4. The smaller size makes the Q4 more flexible in traffic and parking situations.\nA typical scenario. Audi e-tron is filling a parking space. The size difference can be a deciding argument for Q4 for many people.\nCargo capacity The cargo space is about 27% larger on the e-tron than the Q4. Q4 does not have any frunk, like the Audi e-tron.\ne-tron can pull a trailer up to 1800kg, while Q4 only has a 1200kg trailer capacity.\nExterior Both Audi e-tron 55 and Audi Q4 e-tron are available with various standard colors, wheels, optics, panoramic roof, s-line exterior, etc.\nAudi exclusive colors are available on the Audi e-tron. But it comes at a cost and probably not something that would be a deciding factor.\nInterior There is a more significant difference for the interior. Both models are available with standard and s sports seats.\nAudi e-tron has, in addition, sports seats and individual contour seats.\nIndividual contour seats are available with massage and ventilation. Both have options for an S-line interior and multicolor ambient lighting.\nAudi e-tron also has interior styling options like a full leather dashboard and glass buttons.\nIndividual contour seats in Audi e-tron In addition, the quality of the materials used in the Audi e-tron is more premium, giving it a more luxurious feeling.\nCharging Both models have 11KW as standard charging for AC. For DC, the Audi e-tron has 150KW, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 125KW. But the difference is more extensive since the charge curve is market-leading for the Audi e-tron making it one of the fastest charging models. Audi e-tron has an option for a 22KW charger.\nDriving assistance Both models are available with almost the same driver-assist systems. However, there is a difference in what is standard. Night vision, intersection assist and pre-sense side is only available on the Audi e-tron.\nInfotainment For infotainment, there are some differences. Virtual Cockpit and MMI Navigation are standard on the Audi e-tron, while this is an option on the Q4. The MMI system is also different. On the Audi e-tron, there are two screens, while Q4 has only one screen in the center console.\nJust one screen has some drawbacks since you lose some functionality available on the second screen and other functionality needs to only use the area on the first screen, like the navigation search.\nFor some, the physical buttons for the AC on Q4 are an advantage.\nOne screen Audi MMI touch on Audi Q4 e-tron Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro have an option for Sonos sound system. Audi e-tron has an option for Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen. The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen is a better sound system but probably not so much better than someone would choose a model just based on this factor.\nLights HD matrix is an option on both models. In addition, Q4 has some fabulous new daylight driving lights as an option where drivers can select a different design. For e-tron Digital HD Matrix also is available.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t believe that exterior lights will be a deciding factor for many.\nNoise insulation The Audi e-tron 55 has better noise insulation. As a result, road noise is better damped on the Audi e-tron. The extra noise insulation is one of the reasons the e-tron is much heavier than the Q4 e-tron.\nStandard equipment Audi Q4 e-tron 50 has a lower starting price.\nMuch of this difference is because of standard equipment on the e-tron and not on Q4.\nThe following equipment is standard on the e-tron 55, but options on the Q4 e-tron 50 quattro\ne-tron rear light strip MMI navigation Virtual cockpit Heatpump 40:20:40 rear seats Cruise control Headlight washer Powered tailgate Drive select Adaptive air suspension (not available on the Audi Q4) In some markets, the base models are not available, and the list with standard equipment in that market can include more on both models.\nAvailable options Most options are available on both models, but some are only available on the e-tron. These are:\nIndividual Contour seats Ventilated seats Sport seats with adjustable headrest Massage seats Length adjustable headrest Night Vision Crossing assist Pre-sense side Air Quality package Full leather interior Adaptive wipers Servo closing doors Powered adjustable steering wheel Seat memory passenger seats Glass buttons Direct TPMS Audi connect key Spare wheel Rear window curtains Heated rear seats Virtual mirrors Additional charge port 22KW AC charging Orange painted calibers If one or more of these options are essential for you, this can be a deciding factor.\nPrice The starting price is significantly lower on the Q4 e-tron 50 than Audi e-tron 55. But different markets have different packages that give various price differences. In markets where the buyers freely can select options, the starting price difference is about $20.000 / £20.000\nAudi e-tron 55 quattro and Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro So which one should you select? As typical, it all depends on your different needs and preferences.\nFor the one that prefers range and consumption The Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro is the clear winner for this category. More range and much lower consumption.\nFor the family with the need for much storage The Audi e-tron has a larger cargo capacity and more room for the passenger. Suppose maximum cargo capacity is the deciding factor. Then, the Audi e-tron 55 win this.\nFor the ones with a focus on comfort and luxury With the possibility of individual contour seats with massage and ventilation, adaptive air suspension, and leading sound insulation Audi e-tron wins this.\nSpec comparison Below you see the full specification and options comparison of the models.\nQ4 e-tron 50 quattro e-tron 55 quattro Peak electrical output in KW (hp) 195(265) 265(360) Peak electrical output boost in kW (hp) 220(299) 300 (408) 0 -100 km/h (62.1 mph) in s(boost) ?

The electrolyte carries the positively charged lithium ions from the Anode to the Cathode.\nThis reaction in Anode is called reduction and the anode is known as the reducing agent because it loses lithium atoms.\nThe Cathode is known as the oxidizing agent because it accepts lithium-ions from the anode.\nWhen the Anode release positive Lithium-ions, at the same time it frees electrons from the lithium atoms of the electrode.\nThese free electrons congregate inside the anode. As a result, the two electrodes have different charges:\nThe anode becomes negatively charged as electrons are released, and the cathode becomes positively charged as positive lithium-ions are consumed.\nThis difference in charge causes the electrons to want to move toward the positively charged cathode. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to get there inside the battery because the separator prevents them from doing so. The charge is measured in volt and depends on the chemistry used. A typical Lithium-ion cell has a charge between 3.6 - 4.2 volts depending on the state of charge (SOC).\nIn an EV we can take advantage of that desire for the electrons to re-unite with the positive lithium-ions in the cathode. If we create an external circuit through an electric motor or another electronic component we can the flow of electrons drive the motor.\nThe current collectors work as an electrical conductor between the electrode and external circuits.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/drivingassistance/collisionavoidanceassist/","title":"Audi e-tron GT collision avoidance assist","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT can be equipped with collision avoidance assist.

The driver is informed of the intervention by an indicator in the instrument cluster.\nFirst, a jolt is produced to warn the driver of the hazard. If the driver then actively avoids the obstacle, the assistant applies a slight steering torque that helps by correcting the driver’s steering input or helping to make a lane change. Models like the Audi Q8 e-tron use a specific braking of individual wheels – with it the vehicle is made to follow the computed course.\nCollision avoidance This is part of the tour package with option id PCC on Audi Q8 e-tron\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/drivingassistance/crosstrafficassistrear/","title":"Audi e-tron GT cross traffic assist rear","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT can be delivered with Cross traffic assist rear.

The Audi pre sense front and Audi pre sense basic safety systems as well as the lane departure warning system and cruise control system are standard features.","content":" The optional systems are subdivided into the “Tour” (PCC), “City,” and “Park” (PCV) packages, which are combined in the assist system plus. The night vision assist and surround view cameras, which offer a choice of different views, are available as additional individual options. They are also available in the “Park” package.\nThe most important system in the “Tour” assist package is adaptive cruise assist, which combines the functions of adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, and active lane assist. It can largely take over longitudinal and lateral guidance for the driver in many situations. In order to maintain the latter, the driver needs to move the steering wheel slightly at certain intervals. When the predictive efficiency assist (standard) is active, the adaptive cruise assist decelerates and accelerates the Audi e-tron GT in such a way that it consumes as little energy as possible. To do so, it evaluates information from the onboard sensors and navigation data, provided that route guidance is active.

In the table below you see the total buffer for all e-electric models from Audi.\nModel Battery Buffer Avaiable e-tron 55/S 95 kWh 8.5kWh (9%) 86.5 kWh e-tron 50 71 kWh 6.3kWh (8.9%) 64.7 kWh (RS) e-tron GT 93.4 kWh 9.7kWh (10.4%%) 83.7 kWh Q4 e-tron 40/45/50 82 kWh 5.4kWh (6.6%) 76.6 kWh Q4 e-tron 35 55 kWh 3kWh (5.45%) 52 kWh But many people believe this buffer protects it against charging to 100%. But in most cases, all or almost all buffer is on the bottom to protect the battery from running empty.\nSo even e-tron 55 has a relatively large buffer, charging to 100% is not good for the battery. Audi recommends not to charge more than 80% on daily basis. This is shown in the MMI and the user manual.\nThe graph below shows a generalized stress level depending on the charge level.\nBased on this the optimal is probably to keep it between 30 and 70%, but how much better it is compared to just charge to 100% is impossible to know.\nThe buffers are in reality limits on the max and minimum voltage each cell can have. Having a 4% buffer on top means the voltage on each cell is limited to a max of 96% of the max voltage.\nNumber of charge cycles The number of charge cycles affects the degradation.\nThe diagram below shows hows the battery degrade based on charging habits. Based on this, the best is to keep the charging levels around 50%.\nHigh Temperature High temperatures hurt the battery. If you live in an area with high temperatures, you should try to avoid having the car parked in the heating sun all day.\nYou can find more about degradation in our battery guide.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/comparisons/q455q6q855/","title":"Q4 e-tron 55 quattro vs Q6 e-tron quattro vs Q8 e-tron 55","tags":[],"description":"Here, you find a detailed comparison between the Audi Q4 e-tron 55 quattro, the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro, and the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 quattro.","content":" Even though these models are in different categories, their prices can be in the same range depending on the equipment level. In addition, people might be willing to increase or reduce their budget depending on the value of money and features. This article will detail the difference between the Audi Q4 e-tron 55 Quattro, the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 Quattro, and the new Audi Q6 e-tron Quattro.\nAudi Q4 e-tron Introduction The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 was presented in September 2022 It is an upgrade of Audi’s first all-electric model, the Audi e-tron. It is based on the MLB-Evo platform, which is also used in traditional models.\nIn September 2023, Audi presented the Audi Q4 e-tron 55, upgrade from the 2021 Q4 e-tron 50.\nThis model uses a dedicated EV platform called MEB, Volkswagen created this platform, which is also used by several other models. The Audi Q6 e-tron had its world premiere on March 18, 2024, and is built on the PPE platform developed by Porsche and Audi.\nConsumption According to the specification, the consumption of the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 is 20% higher than that of the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro, while that of the Audi Q4 e-tron 55 is about 3% higher than that of the Q6. In the real world, you can see up to a 35% difference in consumption. The main reasons for this are more efficient motors, less weight, and a smaller size that causes less aerodynamic drag.\nAudi Q6 e-tron Range Because of the low consumption, the Q6 e-tron quattro has a better range even though the battery is 12% smaller. As a result, the range difference would, in most driving conditions, be 15-25% better on the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro compared to a similar equipped Audi Q8 e-tron 55.\nIn the real world, depending on weather and driving style, the range on the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 would be between 320-550km, while on the Audi Q4 e-tron, the range would be 300-500km in similar conditions.\nPerformance The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 has 408 hp, The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro 382 and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 340 hp. The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro is the most performant model because of its lighter weight and sporty setup.\nSuspension The Audi Q8 e-tron comes standard with Adaptive air suspension with electronic damping control. The ride height is individually adjusted according to road conditions based on speed and the driver\u0026rsquo;s preferences. The air suspension also offers level control as a function of load. Adaptive air suspension is an option for Audi Q6 e-tron quattro. Aud Q4 e-tron is only available with standard suspension. For many, this is a deciding factor.\nSize The Audi Q8 e-tron is 313 mm longer and 81 mm wider than Q4. The smaller size makes the Q4 more flexible in traffic and parking situations.\nQ6 is 20cm longer than Q4 and is placed in between in size.\nCargo capacity The cargo space on the Audi Q8 e-tron is about 15% larger than that on the Q4. Unlike the Audi Q8 e-tron and the Q6 e-tron, the Q4 does not have a frunk.\nThe Q8 e-tron can pull up to 1800kg, while the Q4 has a trailer capacity of only 1200 kg. The Q6, with its 2400kg capacity, is the clear winner when it comes to trailer capacity.\nExterior All models have various standard colors, wheels, optics, panoramic roofs, s-line exteriors, etc.\nAudi exclusive colors are available on the Audi Q8 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron. But they come at a cost and are probably not a deciding factor.\nAudi Q8 e-tron Interior There is a more significant difference in the interior. All models are available with standard and sports seats. The Audi Q8 e-tron also has sports seats and individual contour seats.\nIndividual contour seats with massage and ventilation are available. Both have options for an S-line interior and multicolor ambient lighting.\nThe Audi Q8 e-tron has interior styling options like a full leather dashboard and glass buttons.\nIn addition, the quality of the materials used in the Audi Q8 e-tron is more premium, giving it a more luxurious feeling.\nCharging All models have 11KW as standard AC charging. For DC, the Audi Q8 e-tron has 170KW, the Q6 e-tron 270KW, and the Audi Q4 e-tron has 175KW. The Audi Q8 e-tron has an option for a 22KW AC charger.\nDriving assistance All models have almost the same driver-assist systems. However, there is a difference in what is standard. Intersection assist and pre-sense side are only available on the Audi Q8 e-tron.\nInfotainment There are some differences in infotainment. Virtual Cockpit and MMI Navigation are standard on the Audi Q8 e-tron, while this is an option on the Q4. The MMI system is also different. On the Audi Q8 e-tron, there are two screens, while Q4 has only one screen in the center console.\nThe Audi Q6 uses a brand new systems with a \u0026ldquo;Digital Stage\u0026rdquo; and a large shared screen. It also have optional passenger screen.\nThis system is much more updated and modern than in Q4 and Q8.\nAudi Q6 e-tron with virtual cockpit, MMI screen, and MMI front passenger screen Audi Q4 e-tron 55 quattro have an option for Sonos sound system. Audi Q8 e-tron and Q6 e-tron have an option for Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen. The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen is a better sound system but probably not so much better than someone who would choose a model just based on this factor.\nLights HD matrix is an option on all models. In addition, Q4 and Q6 has some fabulous new daylight driving lights as an option where drivers can select a different design. For Q8 e-tron Digital HD Matrix also is available.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t believe that exterior lights will be a deciding factor for many.\nNoise insulation The Audi Q8 e-tron 55 has better noise insulation. As a result, road noise is better damped on the Audi Q8 e-tron. The extra noise insulation is one of the reasons the Q8 e-tron is much heavier than the Q4 e-tron. The Q6 is at almost the same level as Q8 when it comes to noise insulation.\nStandard equipment Audi Q4 e-tron 55 has a lower starting price.\nMuch of this difference is due to the standard equipment used compared to the other models.\nThe following equipment is standard on the Q8 e-tron 55 / Q6 e-tron, but options on the Q4 e-tron 55 quattro\ne-tron rear light strip (standard Q8) MMI navigation (Standard Q6 and Q8) Virtual cockpit (Standard Q6 and Q8) Heatpump (Standard Q6 and Q8) 40:20:40 rear seats (Standard Q6 and Q8) Cruise control (Standard Q6 and Q8) Headlight washer (Standard Q8) Powered tailgate (Standard Q6 and Q8) Drive select (Standard Q6 and Q8) Adaptive air suspension (not available on the Audi Q4) (Standard Q8) In some markets, the base models are not available, and the list with standard equipment in that market can include more on both models.\nAvailable options Most options are available on both models, but some are only available on the Q8 e-tron / Q6 e-tron. These are:\nIndividual Contour seats (Q8 e-tron) Ventilated seats (Q6 and Q8) Sport seats with adjustable headrest Massage seats (Q6 and Q8) Length adjustable headrest Crossing assist Pre-sense side Air Quality package Full leather interior Adaptive wipers (Q8 e-tron) Servo closing doors (Q8 e-tron) Powered adjustable steering wheel (Q6 and Q8 e-tron) Seat memory passenger seats Glass buttons Direct TPMS Audi connect key Spare wheel (Q8 e-tron) Rear window curtains (Q6 and Q8) Heated rear seats (Q6 and Q8) Virtual mirrors Additional charge port (Q6 and Q8) 22KW AC charging Orange painted calibers If one or more of these options are essential for you, this can be a deciding factor.\nPrice The starting price is significantly lower on the Q4 e-tron 50 than Audi e-tron 55. But different markets have different packages that give various price differences.

This guide explains how.","content":"When the battery degrades the available battery capacity reduces. This causes a shorter range.\nIf you know how much net capacity your car should have, you can easily check it.\nThis is how you check your battery\nCharge to 100% Take a drive and at least spend 70% of the battery. Try to keep the consumption low. Take a note of your consumption and driving distance Take a note of end SOC (state of charge) (percent left on battery) Calculate actual capacity For the following examples, we assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh net capacity from the factory.\nCalculation in miles Miles example 1 You drive 169 miles with consumption of 2.6 miles/kWh. You started the trip with 100% battery and ended up with 21%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used: 169/2.6 = 65kWh in total.\nIf you had 21% left, you have used 79%. (100%-21%)\nThe current capacity is that 79% = 65kWh.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(65/79)*100 = 82.27kWh.\n82.27 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n82.27/86.5 = 95.1%. Meaning a reduction of almost 5% from the original capacity.\nCalculation in kilometers Km example 1 If you drive 240 kilometers with a consumption of 25kWh/100 You started with 100% and ended up with 16%.\nFirst, you calculate the total energy used\n(280 * 25)/100 = 70kWh in total on the trip.\nIf you have 16% left you have used 84% on the trip (100-16)\n84% = 70kWh battery.\nThe full capacity (100%) can then be calculated:\n(70/84)*100 = 83.333 kWh\n83.333 is the actual capacity of your battery.\n83.33/86.5 = 96.34%. Meaning a reduction of almost 4% from the original capacity.\nWhat affects capacity Just one deviation from capacity does not necessarily mean that your battery has degraded.\nIf you have high consumption there will be some loss because of internal resistance.\nIf your battery was unbalanced it will also affect the battery capacity.\nFor the people that love to keep track of this, we recommend tracking this from the beginning of ownership. In this way you will know your car more.\nThe following example show the stats from an e-tron 55 2020v1 with 83.6kWh capacity from it was new.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/","title":"Audi e-tron GT","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT is the second all-electric model from Audi.

To reduce the dependencies to cobalt different chemistries are used.\nLithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides are the most common chemistry on EV\u0026rsquo;s today.\nThe metal ratio varies. The version was NMC 111, then NMC 622 was the common followed by NCM 711. Many vendors are working on providing cells with an 811 metal ratio.\nLithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA) Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA) are used by Panasonic.\nLithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) Lithium iron phosphate battery\nSeperator A separator is a permeable membrane placed between a battery\u0026rsquo;s anode and cathode.\nElectrolyte Liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries consist of lithium salts in an organic solvent, such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate.\nA liquid electrolyte acts as a conductive pathway for the movement of cations passing from the negative to the positive electrodes during discharge and the opposite direction when charging.\nElectrolytes based on solid materials are areas that many works on. These are called solid-state batteries. Currently, there are no concrete plans for any mass production EV with Solid-state batteries.\nCurrent collector The current collector is used to provide the conduction of electrons from inside the electrochemical reaction to the external part without any reaction within the operation window.\nCurrently used collectors are mostly made of aluminum or copper foils.\nCell Housing Cells for EV\u0026rsquo;s come in 3 different housings\nCylinder housing A cylindrical cell consists of sheet-like anodes, separators, and cathodes that are sandwiched, rolled up, and packed into a cylinder-shaped can. This is the form factor that has been used for years in the market.\nTesla 4680 cylinder battery One advantage is mechanical stability. The round shape of the battery distributes the internal pressure from side reactions over the cell circumference almost evenly. This allows the cell to tolerate a higher level of internal pressure without deformation.\nTesla is one of the few EV manufacturers that uses this.\nPrismatic housing Li-ion cells with prismatic housing consist of large sheets of anodes, cathodes, and separators sandwiched, rolled up, and pressed to fit into a hard-plastic or metallic housing in cubic form. The electrodes can also be assembled by layer stacking rather than jelly rolling.\nSamsung prismatic cells Parts of the electrode and separator sheets of a prismatic cell that are close to the container corners can experience more stress. This can damage electrode coating and lead to the non-uniform distribution of the electrolyte.\nWhen combining prismatic cells into packs, the cell box-like shape enables optimal use of the available space. However, this optimal space is achieved at the cost of more challenging thermal management. This is because there are no space cavities between the cells as there are in a pack of cylindrical cells.\nPouch housing Pouch cells do not have a rigid enclosure like prismatic and cylinder cells and use a sealed flexible foil as the cell container.\nThis makes it the most efficient use of space and achieves a 90 to 95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs, advantages of flexible size, and safety performance. Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight but the cell needs some alternative support in the battery compartment.\nSwelling Pouch Cell Battery as a Result of Gas Generation During Charge and Discharge\nThe electrode and separator layers of a pouch cell are stacked rather than jelly-rolled. With pouch cells, the designer should allocate enough space for the cell swelling. A swelling of as much as 8% to 10% can occur after 500 cycles.\nLG Chem pouch cell Audi cells The below table list the cells used on the different all-electric Audi models.

The predicted delay takes into account future changes to the traffic situation on the route.\nAdditional benefits Using the Audi Q8 e-tron Navigation systems has some additional benefits you don\u0026rsquo;t get when using external navigation from your phone or other GPS unit.\nCalculate what the charge level will be at your destination Calculate range more correctly when the destination is set based on information of the route Inform the Efficient Assitant and Adaptive Cruise Assist about the road ahead so it can reduce speed based on information about the route or speed limit. Inform the driver assist systems about where you are going, so the car can take preventive measures like reducing speed before you are turning off a road. Tell the garage opener you are closing up to your garage so it can atomically select the correct garage door to open.

One-pedal-driving is possible on all-electric Audis.","content":" One-pedal driving is implemented on EVs so that when the driver lifts the foot from the throttle pedal, the electric motors will start regenerating to reduce the speed of the car by up to 0.3G. You never need to use the brake pedal (you can if it is an emergency). That is the reason they call it \u0026ldquo;one-pedal\u0026rdquo; driving.\nUsing regeneration instead of physical brakes can significantly reduce consumption since regeneration puts energy back into the battery instead of creating heat in the physical brakes.\nFor some EVs, one-pedal driving is the only way to regenerate energy and, thereby, the recommended way to drive that specific EV. But for all-electric Audis, there are more efficient ways to do it.\nAll-electric Audis have advanced blended brakes that mix regeneration and physical brakes using the brake pedal. Utilizing the brake pedal, you will regenerate and put energy back into the battery as long as you reduce speed by less than 0.3G. Above that, the system will also use physical brakes. This blending is possible with brake-by-wire technology developed by Audi that controls the use of brakes and regeneration in motors.\nKinetic energy is converted to electric energy in the battery with regeneration. From an efficiency perspective, you should not use one-pedal driving. You only get approximately 80% of the kinetic energy the moving car has back to the battery when doing recuperation. Using one-pedal driving will, for most drivers, mean you will end up doing more recuperation compared to using the brake pedal or letting the car automatically regenerate only when needed.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Audi wants their drivers to maximize the efficiency with coasting instead of automatic, reducing speed when you lift the foot of the throttle pedal.\nUsing one-pedal driving is also less comfortable since you need to have the foot on the pedal at a specific position to freeroll/coast to find the perfect position when no energy is going out of the battery and nothing is going in.\nAudi has made it possible to enable one pedal driving on their all-electric models. It is slightly different on the different models, but the principle Audi follows is the same.\nAudi e-tron On the Audi e-tron you can set recuperation to manual (MMI -\u0026gt; Vehicle -\u0026gt; Efficiency Assistant -\u0026gt; Recuperation). Then every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddles, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot off the “throttle pedal” and works as “one-pedal-driving.”\nYou can set the recuperation to 3 different levels with the wheel paddles. (for more or less braking). High, medium, and off.\nRecommended settings for best efficiency on Audi e-tron If you set its recuperation to automatic, it will only recuperate when you are getting close to other cars or an intersection or need to slow down for different reasons. Otherwise, it will coast and save the maximum amount of energy as long you don’t press the accelerator.\nAudi Q4 e-tron On the Audi Q4 e-tron, there are two methods to enable one-pedal-driving\nBrake mode On the Audi Q4 e-tron, you can set the car in B-mode (brake) with the help of the shifter.\nIn B-mode, the car will regenerate at almost the maximum level available. (depends on charge level and temperature)\nDynamic in D mode with regen level set with paddles The second way to enable one-pedal-driving is by setting the car in D-mode with the shifter and using the Dynamic mode in Drive Select.\nIt is possible to set regen to 0,1,2,3 with paddles, and the car will remember it. Opposite to other drive select modes where the regen level is reset to 0 when using the throttle.\nRecommended settings for best efficiency on Audi Q4 e-tron Driving in D-mode and using the brake pedals that automatically give regen gives the best efficiency. Coast whenever you can.\nAudi e-tron GT On the Audi e-tron GT you can set recuperation to manual (MMI -\u0026gt; Vehicle -\u0026gt; Efficiency Assistant -\u0026gt; Recuperation). Then every time you start a drive, set recuperation to the max with the steering wheel recuperation paddles, and then it will regenerate every time you lift your foot off the “throttle pedal” and works as “one-pedal-driving.”\nYou can set the recuperation to 3 different levels with the wheel paddles.

Available in 7 variants.\nBoth SUV and Sportback versions impress with a new spacious dimension in the interior and pioneering solutions for operation, display, and assist systems. In addition, the augmented reality head-up display connects the virtual and the real worlds in a new way.\nThe world premiere was on April 14. 2021.\nDifferent variants of the Audi Q4 e-tron and Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback This article goes deep into every aspect of the Audi Q4 e-tron. For each area, there are subsections with even more details.\nAudi Q4 e-tron variants Six variants of the Q4 e-tron were available from launch, and later more were added.\nThe variants available are\nAudi Q4 35 e-tron Audi Q4 40 e-tron Audi Q4 45 e-tron quattro Audi Q4 50 e-tron quattro Audi Q4 Sportback 35 e-tron Audi Q4 Sportback 40 e-tron Audi Q4 Sportback 50 e-tron Audi Q4 e-tron has a wide range of options and advanced driving technologies. Here on electrichasgoneaudi.net, you find all details about the Audi Q4 e-tron. Everything from the different wheels to choose from to how the various driving assist system works\nBelow you find every detail you need to know about the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback. You can also access the sections through the menu.\nAudi Q4 e-tron exterior With a powerful body, a high front, and an expressive rear section – the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron exude a strong presence, and they announce themselves as electric Audi SUVs at first glance.\nThe two compact electric SUVs bring the progressive design that the brand introduced at the beginning of 2019 with the Q4 e-tron concept and the Q4 Sportback e-tron concept to series production and represent the next step in the design language of the electric Audi models.\nIts sporty character emerges from the striking proportions – thanks to short front overhangs, large wheels, a broad track and powerfully toned muscles. All lines are drawn with the maximum precision, and the surface treatment has a clear, pared-back effect.\nThe high, upright front symbolizes the robustness and strength of the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. Their dominant element is the large Singleframe – with its eight corners, it is characteristic of an SUV from Audi. A new feature that is typical for electric vehicles is the enclosed Singleframe and the inverted color design: The chrome frame is bordered by a wide mask in a dark contrasting paint finish, a structured surface with horizontal inserts forms the insert for the radiator grille. The Four Rings integrate various sensors as a full-surface element which then disappear behind the brand logo – a new feature at Audi. A powerfully contoured, curved blade extends under the Singleframe, running sharply up at the ends.\nAudi Q4 Sportback When viewed from the side, the unusually flat A-pillars catch the eye – and provide the entire greenhouse with an elegant flow. The roofline stretches low over the body, ending on the Sportback in a long D-pillar. The third side window rises up in an opposing direction – a typical feature of the Sportback. The top of the window points toward the spoiler, which sits on the lower section of the split rear window. On the Q4 e-tron, which has a roof edge spoiler that finishes off the powerful D-pillar, a black insert strip runs across the whole of the roofline. It separates the rear end of the roof visually from the rest of the body and makes it appear to float – an effect that accentuates the sporty character of the vehicle.\nThe sides of both electric SUVs feature taut contours. In both models, the external mirrors sit on the door rail in the style of a sports car. The doors feature overlapping horizontal edges that create an interplay of light and shadow. In the lower area of the doors, striking contours hint at the high-voltage battery pack, the vehicle’s beating heart. The muscular blisters, which extend across the wheel housings, highlight the wheels in a powerful expression and point to Audi’s quattro expertise. They feature a slightly softer and more flowing design than on the models with a combustion engine. The rear blisters run around the D-pillars and into the luggage compartment cover.\nAudi Q4 Typhoon Grey Horizontal lines emphasize the width across the whole of the rear section, while the raised diffusor creates a powerful, sporty accent. An e-tron logo is embossed in the bumper, another one in the Singleframe\nThe color swatch for the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron contains eight colors. Their restrained character is inspired by the colors and hues found in nature. The solid paint color is called stone gray, the metallic shades are named aurora violet (new), floret silver, geyser blue, glacier white, mythos black, Navarra blue, and typhoon gray. Aurora violet is a color that has been taken from Audi Sport.\nAudi supplies both models with the advanced and S line exterior lines as an alternative to the basic version. On the basic vehicle, the wheel arches, the lower section of the bumper, and the diffusor feature an anthracite grain, the gloss package accentuate the side windows.\nThe Singleframe also differs depending on the line – on the S line, chrome elements lend it its own distinctive look. Here, and also in the advanced line, the lower add-on parts feature a contrasting paint finish in metallic Manhattan gray; in the optional full paint finish customers can choose between four colors, while there are also 19- and 20-inch aluminum wheels.\nBlack optics The black optics package, with optional black caps for the exterior mirrors, creates an even sportier appearance. The Four Rings on the Singleframe and the type designation are also available in black in the black optics plus package. A roof rail comes as standard on the Q4 e-tron.\nThe Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron are well-grounded – their wheels comprise eleven versions ranging in size from 19 to 21 inches. Apart from the basic version, these are aluminum wheels, and each size includes especially aerodynamic designs. In the 20-inch category, two wheels come from Audi Sport GmbH, which provides all four in the 21-inch class. One of them comes in a matte bronze finish, another in platin gray. The third is an Aero wheel, which is largely covered with black plastic inlays.\nAll motor line-ups drive off the assembly line with a mix of tires, which further enhances stability and the sporty character. The front tires are 235 millimeters wide throughout, the rear tires 255 millimeters, while the cross sections differ depending on the rim size. All tires are optimized for rolling resistance, the 21-inch class includes a decidedly sporty tire variant for the Sportback\nLearn more about the exterior details and see high-resolution pictures of the exterior in the Audi Q4 e-tron exterior section\nAudi Q4 e-tron interior The new era of technology on which Audi has embarked can also be experienced in the interior of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. The instrument panel introduces itself with progressive elegance and underlines the airy feeling of spaciousness. The cockpit features a distinctly three-dimensional design, and its geometric volumes are interrelated in an electrifying way.\nIn both the electric SUVs, the operating and display units take on the function of design elements more than ever. The digital instrument for the driver is embedded like a diamond between two volumes – a short one on the left-hand side, which incorporates an air vent, and a long one on the right-hand side. It extends all the way to the front passenger door and integrates further air vents. The central MMI touch display, which appears clean and light, occupies the space in front of it. It is tilted toward the driver and is positioned within ergonomically easy reach.\nA lean inlay, known as the tech layer, lies above the display and connects it with the instrument panel. The choice of surface materials for this panel includes open-pore lime wood, aluminum in two different designs, and plastic. The inlay in the S line interior will also be available as an alternative shortly after market launch with an innovative, anthracite-colored technical fabric that is made partly of recycled materials.\nDepending on the equipment package, the further contours of the instrument panel, which are known as accent surfaces, are designed in various silver and gray tones to match the inlay. The most striking of these runs across horizontally, dividing the instrument panel into two zones, and is decorated with an e-tron badge. Below this contour, also facing the driver, lies the climate control operating unit. Below it, a large operating panel with a black-panel look extends into the space. It features the compact shifter for selecting the gears, a capacitive rotary volume control and the start/stop button. The hazard warning light switch as well as the Audi drive select buttons and the ESC stabilization control are designed as seamless touch surfaces in a black panel look and backlit with white backlighting.\nThe steering wheels in the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron are also setting a course for the future of mobility. With their double-spoke design, they belong to a new generation. The Four Rings on the impact absorber feature a flat design, in the S line interior an S emblem adorns the bottom spoke. The upper spokes feature touch surfaces in a black-panel look, where the functional areas are also backlit to indicate the active buttons.\nSlight protrusions separate them from each other, making them easier to use, while the buttons provide feedback that is soft to the touch when pressed. Just as on a smartphone, there are not only touch gestures but also swipe gestures, for example for scrolling through lists.\nThe steering wheels are available in different versions. The top-of-the-range version features paddles affixed to the steering wheel for coasting recuperation and a two-part trim on the spokes. The heated rim is flattened at the top and bottom here – a solution that prominently underlines the futuristic character of the interior. Be it look, function, or feel – the new steering wheel clearly expresses the progressive character of the Q4 e-tron.\nThe seats are available in a basic version and a sport version with visually integrated head restraints, and optionally with a rhombus pattern.\nSeat heating, electric adjustment, and electric lumbar support are available as an option.\nWhen it comes to the seat colors, customers can choose between black, steel gray, Santos brown, and pergament beige. The total of nine equipment packages also includes a stitching package. Five packages are available for the basic version, while the other four are available for the S line interior. They have different door sill trims, paint colors for the accent surfaces, materials for the armrests, and headlining. All optional equipment packages for the interior include white LED lighting, or, alternatively, the multi-color ambient lighting package plus. Some features are reserved exclusively for the S line interior: illuminated aluminum door sill trims with S logo, pedals with stainless steel supports, a black headlining, S embossing in the seat backrests, a steering wheel rim made of perforated leather with contrasting stitching, and S badges.\nThe S line interior also has a great deal to offer in terms of upholstery materials. Customers who prefer traditional materials can choose between a leather/artificial leather mixture and the premium fine Nappa leather. The combination of artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica offers an innovative variant. The Puls upholstery, also in combination with artificial leather, is another option for the S line interior. As with Dinamica, secondary raw materials, for example made from old PET bottles, are also used here.\nSee all details in the Audi Q4 e-tron interior section\nAudi Q4 e-tron drivetrain Audi Q4 e-tron is based on the MEB platform that is shared with other models like Skoda Enyaq, Volkswagen ID4, and ID3.\nBattery It is delivered with 2 battery sizes\n55 kWh gross / 51.5 kWh net on Audi Q4 e-tron 35 82 kWh gross / 76.6 kWh net on Audi Q4 e-tron 40,45 and 50 The range with the biggest battery is between 412 km - 521 km depending on version and equipment trim.\nMotors The Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron include a wide range of drives – from the city cruiser to the powerful quattro. They are being launched on the European markets with two different battery sizes and three motor line-ups. In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only series\u0002production Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 45 e-tron quattro and Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.\nSee all details in the Audi Q4 e-tron drivetrain section\nSuspension The Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron integrate the best conditions for high levels of comfort, driving pleasure, and unshakable stability. In the models with up to 150 kW (204 PS) of power, the rear-wheel drive ensures excellent traction – which the customer can experience in many situations, starting with driving on wet roads. The high-voltage battery is located beneath the passenger compartment, at the lowest point of the car. This is a great advantage for the center of gravity and the distribution of the axle loads: In all drive variants, this distribution is close to the ideal value of 50:50.\nThe front axle of the compact electric SUVs is designed in the classic McPherson construction method, the steering is located underneath at the front. A compact five-link design featuring similarities with the rear axle of the large Audi models works at the rear. As with the front axle, it is mounted on a subframe. Several parts of the suspension are made of lightweight aluminum.\nYou can get optional sport suspension (standard in S line), progressive steering (standard in quattro models), Audi drive select (standard in the Sportback), and suspension with damper control(option available for all models).\nAudi Q4 e-tron technology Audi Q4 e-tron has a lot of advanced technology.\nDriver assistance One front radar, one front camera, four surround-view cameras, two rear radars and eight ultrasonic sensors: When fully equipped, the sensor system of the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron covers a large sensing field and a large number of traffic situations. Important driver assist systems come as standard, the optional systems are subdivided into four packages: the assist package, the assist package plus, the assist package pro, and the safety package.\nOne of the systems equipped as standard is the lane departure warning – its steering interventions can prevent the car from inadvertently straying out of the lane. Using the radar and the camera, Audi pre sense front safety system can identify impending collisions in front of the car, warn the driver, and initiate braking in an emergency. The turn assist system supports the driver in the same way when turning left, the collision avoidance assist helps them steer around obstacles by providing steering movements. The acoustic and optical parking system measures the distance to the rear.\nThe predictive efficiency assist, which evaluates navigation data and traffic signs, helps the driver save energy. When the car is approaching a zone that demands a slow speed – a built-up area, an intersection, or a curve for example – it indicates to the driver that they should take their foot off the right-hand pedal. When they do that, the system manages the coasting and recuperation without the driver having to take any action. Fatigue assist uses defined patterns to continuously check whether the driver is in good shape. The traffic sign recognition system and the predictive speed limiter round off the range of the standard systems.\nLights The headlights of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron are fully equipped with LEDs as standard. On request, Audi also offers the Matrix LED headlights – they lend the two electric compact SUVs a look that is full of character and unmistakable, day and night.\nThe next stage of evolution in daytime running lights is totally new among the competition. Using the MMI touch operating system, the driver can switch between four digital light signatures at any time. Each of them generates its own theme and lends the daytime running lights an individual expression. The variant selected is activated the next time the vehicle is started.\nThe Matrix LED headlights are divided into two sections in terms of optics and technology. The completely black lower half conceals the units for the low beam and the Matrix LED high beam. The 16 individual LEDs that comprise it are regulated so that they always illuminate the road as brightly as possible without blinding other road users.\nThe upper half forms a bright eye. A flat segment runs across the headlights here, serving a dual function in generating a fixed daytime running light and the dynamic turn signals. Above and below it are a total of nine flat daytime running light segments, which, together with the large vertical anchor segment at the outer edge, can be configured into four digital light signatures. Two slat trims made of brushed stainless steel divide the digital daytime running light segments into 49 small sections. Seen from the side, they appear to be well shielded, lying one on top of the other like the slats of vertical blinds; the full power of the individual light segments is easily visible from the front – creating a fascinating effect that plays with light and shadows.\nIn combination with the Matrix LED headlights, there is also a particularly elegant light solution at the rear of the compact electric SUV. A light strip runs across its full width; at its center the taillight beams out in a fine line that splits into separate segments at its ends. Each individual segment is modeled as a three-dimensional body, resulting in a light sculpture that is expressive from all perspectives. The light signature opens up into a large light anchor segment on the sides of the vehicle. Its dynamic graphic is inspired by intricate electric circuits and bears the Four Rings radiating in signature red as the central detail. The dynamic turn signals add a further highlight in the reversing lights.\nWhen the car is unlocked and exited, dynamic “leaving home” and “coming home” light sequences are played in the rear lights and the headlights. The sequences in the headlights vary depending on which daytime running light signature is selected.\nInterface and operations Just as in all of its models, Audi relies on a fully digital operating and display concept with a flat menu structure in the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. It comprises four levels: the digital instrument cluster or Audi virtual cockpit for the driver, the central MMI touch display, the natural-language voice control, and the optional augmented reality head-up display – it is a new, pioneering piece of technology.\nThe standard digital instrument cluster measures 10.25 inches on the diagonal and is operated from the multifunction steering wheel. The power meter, which is located next to the speedometer on the display, summarizes all important information about the drive, from the output and the state of charge of the battery in percent and all the way to recuperation. The Audi virtual cockpit is the first option level. It integrates the navigation map and infotainment control and can be switched between two views. The Audi virtual cockpit is the top-of-the-line version. It offers the “classic,” “sport,” and “e-tron” layouts, where the power meter plays the main part. Various displays can be configured freely here.\nThe MMI touch display with acoustic feedback has a 10.1-inch diagonal and a resolution of 1,540 x 720 pixels. It is used to control the infotainment system as well as a number of comfort functions. In addition, it allows text input in handwriting. In the optional large version, the display comes with an 11.6-inch diagonal and a resolution of 1,764 x 824 pixels. It is the largest display in the Audi portfolio to date and is expected to be available for order this year.\nThe natural-language voice control, which is activated with the key phrase “Hey Audi,” functions as the third control level in the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. It also understands a large number of inputs and queries in everyday language, such as “Where’s the nearest Italian restaurant?” If Audi connect Navigation \u0026amp; Infotainment plus is included, in many cases the information is processed online.\nWith the optional augmented reality head-up display in the Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron, Audi is taking a huge step forward in display technology. The display reflects important information via the windshield on two separate levels, the status section and the augmented reality (AR) section. The information provided by some of the assist systems and the turning arrows of the navigation system as well as its starting points and destinations are visually superimposed in the corresponding place on the real-life outside world as content of the AR section and displayed dynamically. They appear to be floating at a distance of roughly ten meters from the driver. Depending on the situation, they can appear considerably further ahead in some cases. The driver can understand the displays very quickly without being confused or distracted by them, and they are extremely helpful in poor visibility conditions.\nSee all details in the Audi Q4 e-tron technology section\nAudi Q4 e-tron Transportation capabilities In addition to the 5 seats the luggage compartment also offers more space than is generally found in the compact class, matching that of the mid-size class: Depending on the positioning of the rear seat backs, the volume of the luggage compartment is 520 to 1,490 liters in the Q4 e-tron and 535 to 1,460 liters under a power trunk lid in the Sportback. Both models can tow trailers with a weight of up to 1,000 kilograms (braked, at 12% incline), with the quattro versions even able to pull up to 1,200 kilograms\nOn the SUV version you can have up to 75KG on the roof.\nSee all details in the Audi Q4 e-tron transportation capabilities section\nAudi Q4 e-tron specifications Here you find the most relevant specifications for the different Q4 e-tron variants\nSee all details on the Audi Q4 e-tron specifications section\nAudi Q4 e-tron dimensions Where you find the most relevant dimensions for the different variants\nSee all dimensions in the Audi Q4 e-tron dimensions section\nAudi Q4 e-tron knowledge exchange Promoting sharing of knowledge between owners and others with knowledge about the all-electric models from Audi is an important goal with electrichasgoneaudi.net.\nIn our knowledge exchange section, we have collected and answered the most Frequently asked questions about the Audi Q4 e-tron.

More about that later\nTypical a battery pack consists of modules that consist of several cells.\nModules Modules are a combination of cells. The number of cells in a module varies.\nLG battery module Architecture The cells inside a module can be connected in different ways.\nSerial connecting gives a higher voltage Parallel connection gives a higher capacity. Example 1 Below you see how modules on the Audi e-tron 55 are. There are 12 cells per module. They are grouped into 3 groups where 4 cells are connected in parallel. Then those groups are connected in serial giving it a 3 serial 4 parallel configuration (3s4p). With 60AH for each cell and a nominal voltage of 3.66 volts, this module has a capacity of 240AH and 11 volts.\nExample 2 Below you see how modules on the Audi e-tron 50 are.

The problem with today\u0026rsquo;s approach with Cell2Modules is that the energy density on the battery system is much lower than on the cell level. This is because of all the structural elements in a battery that does not add any energy content to a battery pack.\nTo reduce this problem Volkswagen is moving to a Cell2Pack technology where Audi with its Artemis project will launch the first car in late 2024.\nThe technology is based on putting the cells directly in to the pack increasing the energy density to the battery system. This reduces weight and increases capacity.\nOn March 15. 2021 the Volkswagen group that Audi is part of, presented their strategy as part of Power day.\nVolkswagen Cell2Pack technology Volkswagen Cell2Pack comparison See the complete presentation.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/buttons/","title":"Audi e-tron button styles","tags":[],"description":"You can order the Audi e-tron with different button styles","content":" Standarbuttons for MMI Standarbuttons for electric windows Standarbuttons for lights Buttons in black glas finish To get a nicer look, you can order control keys in a black glass finish.\nControl keys and light keys in black glass finish.

The information provided by some of the assist systems and the turning arrows of the navigation system as well as its starting points and destinations are visually superimposed in the corresponding place on the real-life outside world as content of the AR section and displayed dynamically. They appear to be floating at a distance of roughly ten meters from the driver. Depending on the situation, they can appear considerably further ahead in some cases. The driver can understand the displays very quickly without being confused or distracted by them, and they are extremely helpful in poor visibility conditions.\nThe field of view for the AR content from the driver’s perspective is equivalent to a diagonal of around 70 inches. Below it is a flat near-field area window, known as the status section. It displays the speed driven and the traffic signs as well as the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. It appears to hover about three meters in front of the driver.\nHeadup display The heart of the system: the picture generation unit The technical heart of the augmented reality head-up display is the picture generation unit (PGU), which is located deep inside the long instrument panel. A particularly bright LCD directs the light beams it generates onto two level mirrors, and special optical components separate the portions for the near-field and distant areas. The level mirrors direct the beams onto a large concave mirror that can be adjusted electrically. From there, they reach the windshield, which reflects them into what is known as the eyebox and thus onto the driver’s eyes. At an apparent distance of ten meters, or even further away depending on the situation, the driver sees the symbols just as clearly as their real-life environment.\nHeadup display unit Predictive picture generator: the AR Creator What is known as the AR Creator serves as the mastermind and picture generator on the software side – this is a processing unit in the modular infotainment platform (MIB 3) that is comprised of multiple individual modules. The AR Creator renders the display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapts them to the geometry of the projection optics. At the same time, it calculates their location in relation to the environment, on which it obtains information via the raw data of the front camera, the radar sensor, and the GPS navigation. Its software consists of roughly 600,000 lines of programming code, around 50 percent more than the entire control system of the first version of the Space Shuttle.\nWhile performing its computing work, the AR Creator takes into account that there are always a few fractions of a second between the identification of an object by the sensors and the output of the graphic content. During these brief time windows, the Q4 e-tron can change its position considerably, whether due to braking or a pothole. Multiple computations are performed continuously to ensure that the display in the eyebox does not jump into the wrong position. One of them takes place in the camera software. For another, the AR Creator uses the most recent data to make a predictive calculation of the car’s continued forward movement. In a further computation, it estimates the vertical movement on the basis of data supplied by the camera, the radar, and the sensors of the stabilization control (ESC). These insights are incorporated into the “shake compensation,” which takes place a few milliseconds before the picture is output and whose task is to prevent any disruptive shaking of the display.\nHeadup display Navigation: the drone flies ahead The augmented reality head-up display demonstrates its strengths in a particularly impressive way during navigation. On the road, what is known as the drone – a floating arrow – shows the next point of action on the route. It is dynamic: When approaching an intersection, for example, the floating arrow first announces the turning maneuver before an animated arrow steers the driver onto the road with precision. If the route then continues straight ahead, the drone flies ahead and disappears in order to then reappear with sufficient time before the next point of action. The distance to the turning point is displayed in meters in the lower window of the near-field area.\nEven if the driver has activated the adaptive cruise assist, which keeps the car in the center of the lane, the augmented reality head-up display assists them with visual hints. As soon as the Q4 e-tron approaches a lane marking without the turn signal having been activated, the lane departure warning superimposes the real-life lane marking with a red line. Another example is regulation in relation to a vehicle driving in front: If it is active, the car is marked on the display with a colored stripe – this allows the driver to understand the status of the adaptive cruise assist or adaptive cruise control without being distracted. A red marking and a warning symbol appear if the adaptive cruise assist prompts the driver to verify that they are paying attention.\nHeadup display "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/headliner/","title":"Headliner design","tags":[],"description":"You can order the e-tron GT with two different interior headliner colors","content":" Standard black roof option 6NJ Dinamica roof Option 6NC "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/headliner/","title":"Audi e-tron headliner design","tags":[],"description":"You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors","content":" Standard moon silver Standard roof in moon silver Black rooflining You can order Audi e-tron with black headliner .

Their continuous high beams can shine with maximum brightness without blinding other road users. Option ID 8G4\nMatrix LED with Laser Headlights with laser Topping the range are the matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light. In the center of the headlights, between the low beam and high beam modules, there is a laser spot that is activated from a speed of 70 km/h (43.5 mph) and doubles the range of the high beam. It is framed by an X-shaped trim with expressive design that is a small work of art in itself. Its lower section consists of free-standing eleme\nLED taillights Taillights A sculpted light strip spans the entire width of the rear end of the e-tron GT. It transitions dynamically into arrow segments that increase in size toward the outside, thereby creating an unmistakable, lean tail light signature. Independently of the headlight configuration, the rear lights are fitted entirely with LEDs and dynamic turn signals that spreads out flat under the tail light signature. The brake light is located below, in a low and dark area.\nComing home and leaving home animation: character made visible The top-of-the-line headlights offer another characteristic feature: coming home and leaving home animations at the front and rear. The leaving home sequence, which is activated when the doors are unlocked, is inspired by the power of a sound wave: The illumination of the individual elements builds up quickly and strongly, then retreats briefly before going all in the second time.

With a color temperature of around 5,500 Kelvin, their light resembles daylight and hardly causes any eye fatigue – especially in the dark and in the case of adverse weather conditions. In addition, LED headlights offer longer visual range than xenon headlights. In fog and precipitation, they cause the driver less glare. The LEDs are maintenance-free and designed to last the life of the car. The give the Audi models a distinctive look and strong accents with their innovative daytime and nighttime designs.\nDepending on the model the LED headlights are designed differently. In the Audi A5, for example, 26 LEDs per headlight generate all lighting functions. In each headlight, 14 LEDs work together to generate the low and high beam lights, and they are supplemented by a module for the all-weather and turning lights. A light conductor along the upper border of the headlight generates the daytime running lights, parking lights and turn signal lights. Special illumination functions are available for intersections, country roads, expressways and poor weather – and their interplay with the navigation system makes their range of performance even greater.\nHD Matrix LED headlights Matrix LED headlights produce the high beam with tiny light-emitting diodes that are bundled in common reflectors or lenses, depending on the model. With their intelligent function, they illuminate the road superbly without blinding other road users.\nWhen the light switch is set to Automatic and the high beams are on, the system is switched on outside of urban areas at speeds of 30 km/h (18.6 mph) and above. As soon as the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles or city limits, the controller switches off individual LEDs or dims them in 64 stages, creating several million possible light patterns.

The design is based on a technology abbreviated as DMD (digital micromirror device) and is also used in many video projectors. At its heart is a small chip containing one million micromirrors, each of whose edge length measures just a few hundredths of a millimeter. With the help of electrostatic fields, each individual micromirror can be tilted up to 5,000 times per second. Depending on the setting, the LED light is either directed via the lenses onto the road or is absorbed in order to mask out areas of the light beam.\nDigital Matrix Head lights In the Audi e-tron Sportback, the digital light that will expand the offering in mid-2020, performs multiple tasks. It can generate dynamic leaving- and coming-home animations that appear as projections on a wall or on the ground. This presentation transforms the area in front of the car into a carefully illuminated stage. Not only does the digital light system deliver cornering, city, and highway lighting as versions of the low-beam light with exceptional precision, it also supplements the high-beam light by masking out other road users with even greater accuracy. Above all, however, it offers innovative functions such as lane light and orientation light. On freeways, the lane light creates a carpet of light that illuminates the driver’s own lane brightly and adjusts dynamically when he or she changes lane. In this way, it improves the driver’s awareness of the relevant lane and contributes to improved road safety. In addition, the orientation light uses darkened areas masked out from the light beam to predictively show the vehicle’s position in the lane, thereby supporting—especially on narrow roads or in highway construction zones—the safe lane centering assist. The marking light function is also used in conjunction with the optional night vision assist.

The next stage of evolution in daytime running lights is totally new among the competition. Using the MMI touch operating system, the driver can switch between four digital light signatures at any time. Each of them generates its own theme and lends the daytime running lights an individual expression. The variant selected is activated the next time the vehicle is started.

The completely black lower half conceals the units for the low beam and the Matrix LED high beam. The 16 individual LEDs that comprise it are regulated so that they always illuminate the road as brightly as possible without blinding other road users.\nThe upper half forms a bright eye. A flat segment runs across the headlights here, serving a dual function in generating a fixed daytime running light and the dynamic turn signals. Above and below it are a total of nine flat daytime running light segments, which, together with the large vertical anchor segment at the outer edge, can be configured into four digital light signatures. Two slat trims made of brushed stainless steel divide the digital daytime running light segments into 49 small sections. Seen from the side, they appear to be well shielded, lying one on top of the other like the slats of vertical blinds; the full power of the individual light segments is easily visible from the front – creating a fascinating effect that plays with light and shadows.\nSee video below how HD Matrix works on an e-tron\nStriking taillight signature: the light strip at the rear In combination with the Matrix LED headlights, there is also a particularly elegant light solution at the rear of the compact electric SUV. A light strip runs across its full width; at its center the taillight beams out in a fine line that splits into separate segments at its ends. Each individual segment is modeled as a three-dimensional body, resulting in a light sculpture that is expressive from all perspectives. The light signature opens up into a large light anchor segment on the sides of the vehicle. Its dynamic graphic is inspired by intricate electric circuits and bears the Four Rings radiating in signature red as the central detail. The dynamic turn signals add a further highlight in the reversing lights.\nTaillight without matrix with no light bar and only 1 reversing light Taillight with matrix with light bar and 2 reversing light Illustration with and without matrix When the car is unlocked and exited, dynamic “leaving home” and “coming home” light sequences are played in the rear lights and the headlights.

Its matrix extends from SUVs and crossover models all the way to sedans.\nAs it is designed exclusively for electric drives, the MEB allows customers to experience all the advantages that compact electric motors, and lithium-ion batteries in different sizes and capacities offer. The battery systems, electric motors and axle designs form a stringent technology toolkit.\nModels from oter brands that currently use MEB are\nVW ID3 VW ID4 VW ID6 Skoda Enyaq Cupra Born Skoda Enyaq is built on MEB In contrast to the current models with combustion engines, the front section is considerably shorter—the front axle and firewall move forward, making the wheelbase and thus the usable interior space considerably larger.\nIn terms of interior length, each MEB model thus corresponds to a current vehicle from the next higher category. While the exterior dimensions of the Q4 e-tron concept are comparable to those of the Q3, it offers the interior dimensions of a Q5. The architecture of the dashboard also offers new design opportunities.\nOf course, the MEB platform also offers different performance levels and drive layouts. In addition to the typical quattro all-wheel drive with an electric motor at the front and rear axles, there are also drive variant with a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive for the entry level variants.\nThe world premiere for Audi Q4 e-tron, the first Audi model based on MEB was April 14. 2021.\nIt comes with different setups with 2 different battery sizes and both 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive (quattro) version.\nLater the Audi Q5 e-tron had its world premiere.

In this article, we will try to show how much regeneration can affect consumption.","content":" We will first explain the concept and then give you some scenarios to show how much is regenerated.\nWe will then go into physics and explain the math behind the scenarios for those who want to understand the details.\nIn the end, we discuss if regeneration of energy is always the best option.\nHow does it work? The regeneration happens when the electric motors are used as generators to reduce the speed of a moving vehicle.\nFor quattro models, like the Audi e-tron, both engines can be used for regenerative braking depending on the scenario.\nFor coasting and light braking, only the rear motor is used, but when cornering or hard braking both motors are used.\nThe brakes also blend in the physical brakes if needed mixing it with the regenerative brakes seamlessly.\nCoasting regeneration The below video shows in detail how the different engines are used.\nHow much can be regenerated? The following scenarios use math and physics to explain how large the benefits of regenerative braking are.\nThe details behind the calculation are explained in the physics chapter, but you should know that a moving object has kinetic energy that can be regenerated and a car located in an elevated position has potential energy that can be regenerated.\nIn addition, there is aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance that are forces that works against the movement of the car.\nThe drivetrain is also not without loss, which means that some energy is lost in the conversion of energy. Either from power on the battery to movement of the car, or vice versa, from movement on the car to power on the battery. On the Audi e-tron, this efficiency is about 80%.\nScenario 1: Pikes Peak Let\u0026rsquo;s take Pikes Peak as an example. This mountain is 14.110 ft (4300 meters) high but if you drive down the first 18.6 miles you have dropped 6538 ft (1993 meters)\n1993 meters for an Audi e-tron 55 at 2900kg is 15.74kWh in potential energy.\nDriving down Pikes Peak in Audi e-tron 18.6 miles is 30 km. The speed down is low and based on rolling resistance and speed at 40km/h have an energy consumption of 10.52kWh/100km.\nFor 30km /18.6miles this means 3.15 kWh in total. This energy will be taken from the potential energy.\nThis means 12.59kWh to regenerate. With 80% efficiency, this would mean 10.07kWh back into the battery.\nIn the video below you see a real-world test of just exactly this trip and how much they are able to regenerate.\nScenario 2: Fully stop from 75mph In this scenario, the car is moving at 75mph (120.7km/h) and needs to make a full stop for a red light.\nMaking a full stop from 75mph As shown in the graph below 75mph for a 2900kg Audi e-tron gives the total kinetic energy of 0,473 kWh.\nWith 80% drivetrain efficiency, this means the car will be able to get 0.38kWh back to the battery.\nA full trip on 100km (62 miles) with 10 full stops like this would then save 3.8kWh for the total trip compared with a car with only friction brakes.\nThis means a consumption reduction of 3.8kWh/100km.\nScenario 3: Reduce speed from 30 mph to fully stop Making a full stop from 75mph This scenario is a typical city driving scenario. When driving at 30 mph (48.28km/h) the Audi e-tron has a total kinetic energy of 0,0756kWh.\nBased on the 80% efficiency of the drivetrain this saves 0,061kWh back to the battery.\nIf you drive 100km in city traffic and need to make 100 stops like this, you save 6,05 kWh energy.\nThis reduces energy consumption by 6.05kWh/100km compared to a car with only friction brakes\nScenario 4: Driving down from Saltfjellet mountain This mountain is located in Northern Norway and the main road from South to North passes over it (E6).\nIf we take this section of the road where it starts to go downhill we see that the start is at 650 meters (2132feet) and it ends at 125 meters (410 feet) above sea level. With a distance of 16.4 km (10.2 miles), this gives a decline of 3.1%\nThis means potential energy of 4.147 kWh.\nThe speed limit is 80km/h (49.7mph) and based on standard consumption on a dry road, this would mean that this car requires 2.49kWh to roll this distance driven by the potential energy.\nThe rest could be regenerated, and with 80% efficiency, this gives 1.3kWh back in the battery.\n1.3kWh should give 6.8km additional range in 80km/h (49.7mph)\nUnderstanding the physics Kinetic energy A moving object has kinetic energy. This energy depends on the weight of the object and the speed of the object.\nThe formula is\nWhere\nKE = kinetic energy in Joule m = mass of a body v = velocity of a body in meters/second In addition, 1 Joule is 2.778·10⁻⁴ Wh\nIn all calculations on this page, we use the Audi e-tron 55 with a weight of 2900kg in the examples (car + driver). The below table shows how much kinetic energy this car will have in common speeds-\nSpeed km/h mph m/s Kinetic energy 50 kmh 31.07 mph 13.89 m/s 0,0777 kWh 80 km/h 49,7 mph 22.222 m/s 0.199 kWh 104.7km/h 65 mph 29.0575 m/s 0.34 kWh 120.7km/h 75 mph 33.528 m/s 0.453 kWh You can use this kinetic energy calculator for other speeds. See also the graph below.\nRotational kinetic energy In addition to the kinetic energy of the car itself, the wheels spinning on the car also contain rotational kinetic energy that can be regenerated.\nThe formula for rotational energy\nE: the rotational kinetic energy, expressed in Joules. I: the moment of inertia of the object, expressed in kg*m². ω: the angular velocity of the body, expressed in radians per second For a wheel moment of inertia can be calculated\nI = M * R²\nFor an Audi e-tron, we do the calculation for the wheel option 265/40 R22. With an estimated weight of 30 kg per wheel and a radius of 38.54 cm you get\nI = 30 * 0.3854^2 = 4,4559948\nFor 80km/h the wheel will spin with 566.89 rpm and the resulting kinetic energy would be 8.724 Wh or 0,008724 kWh for 4 wheels.\nNote: This is not 100% correct since the formula is based on a wheel with the same form from center to edge. But it is close enough for this kind of calculation.\nIf you want to calculate you can try the Rotational Kinetic Energy calculator\nGravitational/Potential energy Potential energy exists when the car is located at an elevated location compared to the destination.\nThe formula is quite simple.\nU: gravitational energy in joule m: mass in kg g: gravitational field 9.8 m/s^2 on surface h: height in meters For example, the Audi e-tron 55 on 2900kg located at 1000 meters (3280 feet) above sea level will have the potential energy of 7.8998 kWh (28.492.85 Joule)\nIn areas with elevation, the potential energy will be the biggest source of regenerated energy.\nSee potential energy calculator\nSummary The below graph shows the total kinetic energy and the two types of kinetic energy.\nGraph over kinetic energy Understanding energy consumption Before we give you an example of how much energy can be regenerated, we need to explain energy consumption. Because this affects the result.\nConsumption by aerodynamic drag A moving car will have forces based on air resistance that will push against the movement.\nAudi e-tron in wind tunnel The formula for drag is:\nP: Air density (1.225 on the ground at 15 °C) u: Speed in meters/second A: Frontal area of the car (2.65m2 on Audi e-tron) CD: 0.28 on Audi e-tron 55 Based on this as an example. 80km/h requires power on 4.9kW (6.23kWh/100km) to overcome aerodynamic drag\nNote that the power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity, so an Audi e-tron 55 traveling at 160km/h requires 39,89 kW (24,94 kWh/100km) to overcome drag.\nTemperature affects density. At -25 the density is 1.4224 and the consumption at 80 km/h increases to 7.23kWh/100km.\nFor all calculations on this article, we assume 15 °C\nRolling resistance In addition to drag force, there is rolling resistance from wheels and other drivetrain components that works against movement.\nIt is not easy to find this number, but with knowing the total consumption and the consumption caused by drag, and the efficiency on the drivetrain it is possible to estimate the rolling resistance on the Audi e-tron.\nBased on driver history it seems like driving on a dry road at 80 km/h in summer temperature requires around 19kWh/100km energy from the battery. If we assume 80% efficiency in the drivetrain, we have an energy need of 15.2kWh/100km in total including drag.\nIf we take away the energy needed for drag, we have around 8.95kWh/100km to overcome rolling resistance.\nThis number is an estimate. On wet roads or roads with snow, the rolling resistance increases.\nConsumption summary The below diagram shows the calculated consumption needed to overcome drag and rolling resistance and consumption from the battery based on 80% efficiency of the drivetrain. The real efficiency is not known but it is expected to be around 80%.\nCalculated consumption See also full table with kinetic energy and consumption for all speeds from 1-100 mph (1-161 km/h)\nIs regen the best option always? Since regenerative braking is only 80% efficient it is best to avoid using it when you can. For scenario 1, driving down Pikes Peak is impossible without regenerative braking. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use regen you will crash. But if you assume flat road on scenarios 2 and 3, you would do better if you look ahead and let the car coast, so it uses the rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag to reduce the speed.\nThis would mean you need to lift your foot from the watt pedal early enough so you stop at the point you want by itself.\nSo how much energy would that save? Two factors reduce total consumption.\nYou will not lose 20% of the kinetic energy when regening You will not lose 20% of the energy trying to keep the speed Theoretical this can save\nScenario 2: 1.89 kWh/100km Scenario 3: 3.02 kWh/100km But this is in the best-case scenario where you can calculate exactly where to lift the foot of the watt pedal. In the real world, this benefit would be smaller since you would end up needing to add some power or braking at the end when you are not able to calculate this correctly.\nCan you see in the car how much was regenerated? A common misunderstanding is that you can look at the range reported in the car to see how much was regenerated.\nThe range meter bases its calculation on the last 100km driven. If we take scenario 4 and assume the car has been driven from sea level up to the top at 650 meters in 80km/h (49.7 mph) the consumption would be 25.4kWh/100km at 650 meters.\nOn the Audi e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery capacity, the range would be calculated to 340km (211 miles) for a full battery based on this consumption.\nAfter driving down the road section scenario 4 the total consumption from the battery would be reduced from 25.4kWh/100km to 21kWh/100km.\nThis would increase the calculated range to 411km (255 miles) for a charged 100% battery (less depending on the real SOC). Based on this you could mistakenly believe that you have regenerated 71km (44 miles), but the correct is 6.8km.(4.2 miles)\nThis type of increase you could even see in scenarios where there is no regeneration, but just a decline that reduced the consumption.\nThe only way to know how much you have regenerated is to look at how much the state of charge of the battery changes from top to bottom of the mountain.\nState of charge, the only way to see how much you have regenerated One pedal driving vs manual/automatic regen On electric Audis, you can use regenerative brakes in different ways\nManual, only using the brake pedal Automatic, letting the car decide when to regenerate Manual, using steering wheel paddles to regenerate One pedal driving - automatic regenerate when lifting the foot off watt pedal All methods use the same electric drivetrain components to do braking, so they have the same efficiency.\nBut one-pedal-driving has a little reduced efficiency in scenarios where the driver wants to transition from using power to coasting.\nSince you would need to keep your foot on the pedal at a specific position to not use any energy or braking you will always spend more time coming to this position compared to lifting the foot directly off the pedal. In addition, it takes some training to keep the foot in perfect position.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why Audi recommends using automatic regen with coasting to save energy.\nThe difference is small, probably less than 10% of the difference between coasting and regenerative braking in the scenarios where coasting is possible.\nFor scenarios like scenario 1, there is no difference since you will do regenerative braking to keep the car on the road.\nSince the difference is so small, you should choose based on your personal preference.\nYou can read more about one-pedal-driving\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/s-line/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron s-line exterior package","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron can be delivered with s-line exterior package.

In this guide, we explain what affects the range of your all-electric Audi and why you don&#39;t see the range as expected.","content":" The range of electric cars is typically given as a WLTP range (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) in Europe or EPA in the US.\nBelow you see the range of the different current and some future Audi models. The range is from 341km (211 miles) to 700km (435 miles) according to the WLTP combined standard.\nWLTP Range all-electric Audis The most important aspect of range is of course how large the battery is. A larger battery means more energy to use.\nThe below chart shows the available battery size for the different models.\nAvailable battery all-electric Audis But the battery is not the only factor in the stated range. Another important factor is how efficient the car is.\nAnd with efficiency, it means how much energy is used from the battery for a given distance. In Europe, it is typical stated as kWh/100km meaning how many kWh is needed to drive 100km. In the US and the UK, it is rated as miles per kWh, meaning how far can you go with 1 kWh.\nThe below diagram shows the calculated consumption in kWh/100km for the different all-electric models is according to WLTP combined rating.\nCalculated consumption kWh/100km What affects the WLTP consumption? The efficiency or WLTP consumption is affected by many attributes of the car.\nAerodynamic drag The aerodynamic drag affects how much energy is needed to move. The shape of the body affects it but also the design of the wheels.\nAudi A6 e-tron concept is currently the model with the lowest drag coefficient with a Cw value on only 0.22\nAudi A6 e-tron with Cw value of only 0.22 In the below graph you see how much consumption the aerodynamic drag causes for the different model series for Audi.\nConsumption caused by aerodynamic dra Beregnede verdier for forbruk som kun kommer fra aerodynamisk luftmotstand basert på 80 % drivlinjeseffektivitet.\nSpeed Audi e-tron 55 Audi Q4 e-tron Audi e-tron GT 50km/h (31mph) 3.04kWh/100km 2.94 kWh/100km 2.31kWh/100km 80km/h (49.7mph) 7.79 kWh/100km 7.52 kWh/100km 5.92kWh/100km 120km/h (74.6mph) 17.53kWh/100km 16.94kWh/100km 13.33kWh/100km Du ser hvordan Audi e-tron GT i høy hastighet sparer mye energi sammenlignet med suven på grunn av mindre aerodynamisk luftmotstand.\nDisse verdiene er basert på luftmotstandskoeffisienten og størrelsen på frontområdet til modellene\nModel Drag coefficient (cd) Frontal area Audi e-tron SUV 0.28 2.65m2 Audi e-tron Sportback 0.26 2.65m2 Audi Q4 e-tron SUV 0.28 2.56m2 Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback 0.26 2.56m2 Audi e-tron GT 0.24 2.35m2 Audi A6 e-tron sportback 0.22 ?m2 Audi A6 Avant e-tron sportback 0.24 ?m2 Rolling resistance The rolling resistance sometimes called rolling friction or rolling drag is the force resisting the motion when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface.\nThis is affected by the width of the tires, the weight of the car, the tire compound, and the tire pressure.\nAudi RS e-tron GT has very wide tires with 285mm to get the best traction. This increases rolling resistance. As an option, you can get 305mm wide tires that increase traction and decreases range.\nAudi RS e-tron GT with 305mm rear tires Some tire producers have started producing specific tires for EV with low rolling resistance that affect range.\nAudi delivers these types of tires on some of the models. See below for a very good and detailed test that describes the difference between EV optimized tires and regular.\nWeight A heavier car requires more energy to move.\nThe efficiency of the drivetrain/motors Electric motors are very efficient by default, but there are still some different technologies that give different consumption based on the setup.\nPermanently excited synchronous use less energy in use but have higher coasting resistance. Induction motors use a little more energy to move but have almost zero coasting resistance.\nNewer cars often combine these two techniques having a rear synchronous motor always in use and an induction motor in front. Example Audi Q4 e-tron quattro 50.\nAudi is working on the new PPE platform and already now we know that this drivetrain will have a improved effiency\nPPE Drivetrain The internal resistance of the battery The internal resistance in the battery causes heat loss in the battery.\nFactors vary based on selected options Many of the above factors are fixed. Like the e-tron Sportback has less drag than the e-tron SUV because of the body shape.\nBut other factors are affected by the equipment you add to your car. If you buy wider tires, you will get a higher consumption and then a shorter range.\nThe below diagram shows hows adding the max options of the car increase the WLTP consumption.\nWLTP Consumption added with options From the diagram, you can see that an Audi e-tron 55 has a consumption of 19.61 kWh/100km in the basic trim, but 23.44 kWh/100km in the top trim. Reducing the range from 441km (274 miles) to 369km (229 miles).\nWhat affects the real-world consumption In the real world, it is almost impossible to get the same range as given by WLTP or EPA. This is because that range is based on ideal driving conditions with specific behavior.\nRoad condition Road conditions are one of the factors that affect consumption. If it is dry tarmac the rolling resistance is much lower than if the road is wet or is packed with snow.\nThe speed High speed increases the consumption because of higher drag.\nThe temperature The temperature affects the range in different ways. If it is cold the air is denser and it is a higher aerodynamical drag.\nIn addition, warm and cold weather could increase the consumption of air condition system in the car.\nBoth the given WLTP and EPA ranges are based on running cars without heating/AC. The diagram below shows how adding 5KW heating on top of the WLTP consumption will affect range. Up to 41% without considering more road resistance.\nThis not something that easily can be resolved. Heatpump can reduce this heat consumption depending on temprature. Better insulation of the cars also\nHow 5KW heating affect range on Audi Q4 50 e-tron and Audi e-tron 55 The driving style You as a driver can improve range a lot.\nLook ahead and coast as much as possible When needing to reduce speed, start reducing when possible so early that you only use recuperation. Audi e-tron S in the wet How does the range indicator work on electric Audi The range indicator on all-electric Audis is much more advanced than many other brands.\nWhile some brands show the same range no matter what and ignore the driving condition or the driving style to the owner, all-electric Audis tries to learn from previous trips and this causes a lot of questions about range from owners since range varies and drops when driving condition worsens.\nBelow you see some typical questions.\nSo how does the range indicator works?\nThe range indicator base its range on the following data\nAverage consumption on the last 100km driven The state of charge (of much is the battery charged) The planned route in the navigation system Virtual cockpit with range indicator So assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery and you have charged it to 100%.\nIf your average consumption was 25kWh/100 on the previous trips, the range indicator, or GOM (guessometer) that many calls it would calculate you would have a range on 346km. If your average consumption was 20kWh/100km it would calculate 432km. And if you are one that likes speed and had an average of 30kWh/100 km your calculated range would be 288km.\nBut this is the best guess based on previous trips. If you change behavior on the next trip, the range calculated would be wrong.\nIf you have done many short trips in cold weather, you would have spent lots of energy to heat up the car. But this average consumption is not relevant if you the next day are taking a long drive. The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/virtualcockpit/","title":"Audi e-tron virtual Cockpit","tags":[],"description":"The Audi virtual cockpit is a fully digital instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch TFT screen.","content":" The virtual cockpit display has a full HD resolution of 1,920 x 720 pixels.

The active digital light signature is another world first making its debut in the Audi Q6 e-tron. It makes an entirely new and vibrant impression, pointing the way to the future of Audi lighting technology. For the first time, customers can optionally select digital light signatures for this new evolution of digital daytime running lights in the Matrix LED headlights and the new generation of digital OLED rear lights. In addition, customers may book digital light signatures on demand.\nThe Q6 e-tron not only marks a new chapter in electromobility at Audi; lighting technology is an important part of Audi’s DNA. With the world’s first active digital light signature, the Audi Q6 e-tron ushers in a new era characterized by distinctive design and aesthetics unique to Audi.\nAudi Q6 e-tron head lights The second-generation of digital OLED technology shapes the look of new Audi models and increases their range of functions many times over. This, in turn, improves road safety, as impressively demonstrated by the communication light in the digital OLED rear lights. The Q6 e-tron also sets new standards in personalization: With a total of eight optional digital light signatures in the redesigned daytime running lights in the Matrix LED headlights and digital OLED rear lights 2.0, customers can design the look of their Q6 e-tron like never before. This is possible via the MMI and, for the first time, via the myAudi app. Customers are also able to buy digital light signatures after purchasing their car.\nSignature and movement combined for the first time: the active digital light signature The headlights and rear lights look alive at first glance – this is how customers should imagine the active digital light signature, a world first from the brand with the four rings. It comes as part of the optional package of digital light signatures. “The Audi Q6 e-tron marks the first time in a production model that we are designing both the shape of the lights and their entire movement. Thanks to a perfect symbiosis between lighting design and the new technology, the new Audi Q6 e-tron lights look more vibrant and intelligent than ever before. We’ve given the light signatures their own personality and the digital world its own aesthetics at the same time”, explains César Muntada, Head of Lighting Design. “With the world’s first active digital light signature, the Q6 e-tron is ushering in a new era of distinctive design and aesthetics unique to Audi.”\nAudi Q6 e-tron head lights A software module in one of the Audi Q6 e-tron\u0026rsquo;s domain computers, jointly developed by Audi and the Group’s software company CARIAD, makes this type of light signature possible. In the case of the second-generation digital OLED rear lights, the six 360-segment OLED panels generate a new image every ten milliseconds using a specially developed algorithm. This algorithm lets the active digital light signature demonstrate the car’s vibrancy and ability to interact personally by making the Q6 e-tron’s “brain activity” visible through constant movement. The active digital light signature at the front is created via the interaction of the algorithm with 12 dimmable segments, while at the rear, all the digital OLED segments are used. The individual light segments interact so that the light signature\u0026rsquo;s overall image does not vary in luminous intensity.\nThe second-generation of digital OLED technology A brief overview of digital OLED technology 1.0: In 2016, Audi introduced a new lighting technology to the automotive industry in the TT RS. It was the first time organic LEDs (OLEDs for short) were used for rear lights. OLED elements are semiconductor-based surface light sources that generate light with perfect homogeneity and high contrast values. Their brightness is also adjustable. In addition, the shape of OLED lights can be configured freely and divided precisely into switchable segments. Dynamic lighting scenarios in the OLED rear lights also debuted in the Audi TT RS.\nAudi Q6 e-tron rear lights In 2020, Audi Q5 customers could select an individual rear light signature for the first time thanks to the digital OLED rear lights. With this accomplishment, Audi became the first automotive manufacturer to modify the rear light signature digitally. The shift was based on OLEDs’ core properties: high contrast, segmentation into switchable zones, high light homogeneity, and the ability to arrange the segments very tightly. Audi remains the only car manufacturer to offer this evolution of technology.\nIn 2022 this option became standard in the Audi A8 with digital OLED rear lights. The car’s bus system allowed its software to control each rear light panel and each OLED segment individually. In the A8, customers could select from three rear light signatures via the MMI; in the S8, they could choose from four.\nAudi Q6 e-tron rear lights “Audi recognized the potential of using OLED technology in rear lights early on and has since continued to systematically advance their development and digitalization as the only car manufacturer to do so. As a result, we can now offer our customers an ever-new range of lighting functions,” explains Stephan Berlitz, Head of Lighting Development, demonstrating a clear strategy behind the use of this technology. “Digital OLEDs are more efficient, lighter, and more homogeneous than traditional lighting systems,” Berlitz continues, offering a glimpse of the future: “Due to their strong contrast, they are gradually turning into exterior displays, making them an important enabler of communication with the car’s surroundings. With the proximity indication function, we have been using light to interact with other road users since 2020. The Audi Q6 e-tron now adds the communication light to improve road safety further.”\nThe second-generation digital OLED rear lights in detail With the next generation of digital OLEDs in the rear lights that now follow in the Audi Q6 e-tron, Audi is significantly expanding the range of functions and design freedom while, above all, improving road safety. For the first time, the digital OLED rear lights can specifically communicate with the immediate environment (car-to-X communication). The number of segments per digital OLED panel has increased from six to 60 compared to the first generation. Six OLED panels with 360 segments in total are used in the Q6 e-tron\u0026rsquo;s rear lights. The new E3 electronic architecture makes it possible to control this significantly increased number of segments using a software module on one of the domain computers. The steady increase in the number of segments per digital OLED panel will, in the future, make it possible to develop the rear of the car into a display that further improves car-to-X communication and road safety.\nAudi Q6 e-tron head lights The innovative digital OLED technology creates the conditions for a completely new rear light design, ensuring a one-of-a-kind homogeneity and very high contrast. There are other advantages: Surface light sources do not require additional reflectors, light guides, or optics, making them very efficient. Together, these properties allow Audi’s engineers and designers to break down the design boundaries between two- and three-dimensionality. In other words, the brand with the four rings is creating three-dimensional shapes on two-dimensional surfaces. In addition to an integrated, expressive LED light strip at the rear, 3D glass successfully separates the rear light signature from the other lighting functions.\nAudi is also innovating the front of the car. The next generation of digital daytime running lights and the light modules are now visually separate, creating greater design clarity. The designers have designed the individual LEDs – 70 in total – in this new evolution of digital daytime running lights as transparent 3D objects. The front section of the digital daytime running lights features a precise prismatic structure, while a metalized 3D trim surrounds them to draw the focus to the car’s digital eyes.\nImproved safety thanks to intelligent headlights and rear lights Audi has also taken the car’s safety features to a new level. Proximity indication, a feature familiar to other Audi models, is expanded in the new Q6 e-tron to include a communication light. Integrated with the digital OLED rear lights, it warns other road users forsighted of accidents and breakdowns by displaying a specific static rear light signature with integrated warning symbols and the regular rear light graphic in critical road situations. The assistance system thus aids Audi drivers forsighted and all other road users. As with the advanced traffic information system in the A8, which warns road users of accidents or hazards via the digitalized headlights, the communication light uses data from the swarm. In addition, second-generation digital OLED rear lights activate the communication light with warning symbols for emergency assist, RECAS (rear-end collision alert signal), hazard warning lights, emergency calls (eCall), roadside assistance calls (bCall), and emergency brake lights.\nThe communication light also adds an extra dimension to the exit warning function. Previously, it only informed the occupants when exiting the car, for example, if another car or a bicycle was approaching. But now, a specially adapted light signature in the rear light graphic warn cyclists or drivers approaching from behind. In this way, the Audi Q6 e-tron extends its safety concept to other road users, increasing road safety for everyone.\nFinally, the communication light also uses a specific light signature at the front and rear to indicate the car’s park assist status when it is in automated parking mode. This makes it clear to road users in the immediate vicinity that the car is safe to approach.\nA new level of freedom: digital light signatures available via the MMI and the myAudi app With up to eight digital light signatures for the headlights and rear lights, drivers can enjoy a new level of freedom in personalizing their Q6 e-tron. Customers can select a signature in one of two ways, via the myAudi app or in the car via the MMI. Six additional signatures with a coming home/leaving home lighting scenario and the corresponding digital light signature are available through additional optional packages.\nVia the myAudi app, customers can activate their personal light signatures from outside the car and experience the dynamic lighting scenario and the coming home/leaving home function right on their car. It’s the same with the communication light in the second-generation digital OLED rear lights and proximity indication. On request, the Matrix LED headlights can provide a live demonstration of the sign glare suppression and object masking features.\nFor an even greater degree of personalization for the Q6 e-tron, customers can book the package of digital light signatures for the LED headlights plus/Matrix LED headlights and digital OLED rear lights after purchasing their car using on-demand functions. Customers can purchase the features permanently or for a specific period. This flexibility lets Audi customers design their Q6 e-tron with up to eight digital light signatures (only in conjunction with digital OLED rear lights and LED headlights plus/Matrix LED headlights) to suit personal preferences. Finally, they can also purchase high-beam assist and the Matrix package on demand.\nPrototype testing and other media Below you find videos and images of the prototype with information about the technology\nAudi Q6 e-tron Experience – Interview with Dr. Michael Kruppa Audi Q6 e-tron Insights – #01 Light Technology Audi Q6 e-tron prototype – Digital light signature and Matrix LED headlights Oled Rear lights "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/technology/battery/batterymanagment/","title":"Battery management","tags":[],"description":"A battery management system (BMS) is the electronic system that manages the battery, such as by protecting the battery, monitoring its state, calculating secondary data as range, and performing balancing of cells.","content":" A BMS often consists of electronics both on the module level and on the pack level.\nBattery management electronics for Audi e-tron battery pack "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/technology/audiconnect/dataplan/","title":"Audi connect data plan","tags":[],"description":"To use Audi connect you need a data subscription either by using your own sim card in the car on some models or via the built-in data subscription in the car.","content":" In Europe, Audi uses Cubic Telecom for the built-in subscription.\nFor the services below, the data amount is included.

Paint colors, body shapes, wheels, paint styles, different optics, color in grille,  mirror types, and many more options making it possible to order the car after your preferences.","content":" The Audi Q6 e-tron has perfect proportions and is a further evolution of Audi\u0026rsquo;s e-tron design. In the car’s bodywork, soft shapes are in constant interplay with the creases and edges, lending dynamism to the shadows even when stationary. The upright front with the completely closed and inverted Singleframe follows the design language specific to electric Audi models. The vertical design of the front end makes a powerful and confident impression. A mask in selenite silver or high-gloss black frames the highly three-dimensional grille and the side air intakes. The high-positioned daytime running lights give the Q6 e-tron a very striking and confident appearance.\nAudi Q6 e-tron in Daytona grey and Plasma blue The greenhouse stretches low and taut over the powerful body. It is slightly tapared towards the rear, and the gently sloping D-pillars flow elegantly into the bodywork’s muscular shoulders. The continuation between the D-pillar and the roof makes the cabin appear more elongated and the vehicle more dynamic. A prominent line that extends from the rear lights to the rear doors emphasizes the upper section of the quattro blisters - the contours of the body on which the gently sloping D-pillars are supported. The blisters are a core element of Audi\u0026rsquo;s design DNA. Audi calls this central design principle \u0026ldquo;making technology visible\u0026rdquo;. Thanks to the taut and precisely drawn quattro blisters, the car embodies a certain dynamism even when stationary. The shape of the Audi Q6 e-tron is reminiscent of the Audi e-tron GT3.\nIts powerful and sporty stance, when stationary, is further emphasized by the strongly tucked-in and sills and aprons accented in black. The almost perfect proportions with short overhangs and long wheelbase support this design philosophy. The sill is set off in black, emphasizing the location of the battery. This is where the heart of the fully electric vehicle with 800-volt technology beats - and the Audi e-tron design philosophy places emission-free driving at the center of the design. The dynamically tapered rear creates a mixture of sporty elegance and power. The clean and large rear architecture with the continuous light strip gives the Audi Q6 e-tron the clarity and aplomb typical of Audi.\nThe exterior of the Audi Q6 e-tron is differentiated between an attractive entry-level variant and the S line variant. At market launch, up to eight exterior colors including the standard color magnetic gray solid as well as Manhattan gray metallic, glacier white metallic, stone red or mythos black metallic are available. They emphasize the powerful and progressive design of the exterior. Two shades of blue are available: plasma blue and Ascari blue. Daytona gray is reserved exclusively for the S line variant and the S model. The black pro styling package can be ordered as an option for the Q6 e-tron with S line or the SQ6 e-tron2. It is characterized by black accents for even more elegance and sportiness. The package includes dark Audi rings at the front and rear, dark window trim, additional parts including the radiator grille in body color, black exterior mirror housings, black inserts in the inverted, closed Singleframe, and the front and rear bumpers.\nThe interplay of exterior colors and exterior packages with contrasting paintwork in mythos black as standard or in body color on request offers plenty of scope for individualization.\nThe Audi SQ6 e-tron2 shows off its electric power in a sporty and elegant way. Silver-colored add-on parts set accents at the front and rear - an exclusive feature for the S models, as do the exterior mirror housings in an aluminum look. The horizontal blade at the rear also has an aluminum look, as do the elements in the side skirts and the Singleframe. The SQ6 e-tron2 comes with black 18-inch brake calipers with a diamond S logo and 20-inch wheels in a five-twin-spoke design in matt palladium as standard.\nSpeaking of the wheel range, the Audi Q6 e-tron starts with 18-inch ten-spoke wheels as standard and the 19-inch \u0026ldquo;5-double-spoke dynamic\u0026rdquo; wheel in graphite gray in the S Line. Wheels up to 21 inches are available as an option. In addition to the standard wheels of the respective Q6 e-tron models, there is a total of seven other different designs - from sporty to elegant - to choose from; four of these come from Audi Sport. The SQ6 e-tron2 starts with 20-inch wheels.\nWhether magnetic grey or Ascari blue metallic, the two edition one models present the Audi Q6 e-tron with visual highlights: S line design, radiator grille in body color, 21-inch wheels, brake calipers in red, dimmed Matrix LED headlights plus, LED rear light pro, exterior package black. With the edition one grey, customers receive a key trimmed to match the car’s color (magnetic grey or Ascari blue) and with the Audi rings on the back.\nSee below for details about the exterior options.\nPaintcolors Audi Q6 e-tron offers a large amount of paint colors to choose from Learn all about Audi Q6 e-tron paint colors Wheels Audi Q6 e-tron offers serveral wheel options Learn all about Audi Q6 e-tron wheel options Painted calibers Audi Q6 e-tron offers painted calibers as an option Learn all about Audi Q6 e-tron painted calibers Panoramic roof Audi Q6 e-tron offers panoramic roof as an option Learn all about Audi Q6 e-tron panoramic roof S-Line exterior Audi Q6 e-tron offers s-line exterior package as an option Learn all about Audi Q6 e-tron s-line exterior package "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q8-e-tron/exterior/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron exterior","tags":[],"description":"There is a huge number of exterior options to the Audi Q8 e-tron.

The driver operates the free-standing Audi virtual cockpit plus via the multifunction buttons on the spokes of the steering wheel. The display measures 12.3 inches in the diagonal and offers a high resolution of 1,920 x 720 pixels. The driver can switch between the “classic,” “sport,” and “e-tron” screens in the MMI operating system. In the e-tron view, the focus is on the large power meter that displays the status of the drive and all important information on electric driving.\nThe central MMI touch display (10.1 inches) is controlled via touch and provides acoustic feedback. This is where the driver manages the infotainment, navigation, comfort functions, and text input. The menu structure is lean and clear, just as on a smartphone, and the MMI search is based on free input. For many searches, the hit list will appear after entering a couple of letters.\n“Hey Audi:” natural language control The third control level is the natural language control which understands numerous expressions from everyday language. It draws information for its responses to commands and questions not only from the information stored on board but also from the cloud. While the onboard information is available particularly quickly, the online information is more extensive. Natural language control can be activated with the wake-up words “Hey Audi.”\nThe optional head-up display can display important information on the windshield. The image window is in the driver’s field of vision, with the projection appearing to float about two meters in front of them. Another convenient feature of the Audi e-tron GT is the personalization: Up to six users – five fixed users and one guest – can each store hundreds of preferred settings in individual profiles. The car adjusts the preferred settings when the driver’s door is opened.\nBehind the control and display functions in the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT is the third-generation modular infotainment toolkit (MIB 3), which offers extremely high processing power. It works with the physically separate communication box, which executes all tasks relating to connectivity at great speed, and has an integrated Wi-Fi hotspot. After the vehicle is started, the MIB 3 with all of its functions, apps, and services boots up within a few seconds. The driver can activate an individual dashboard that displays up to three main applications in separate windows.\nAudi e-tron GT MMI Audi e-tron GT is equipped with the latest evolution stage of its MMI operating concepts with the MMI touch response.\nAudi e-tron GT navigation system Audi e-tron GT has an standard navigation system.

Made up by the Audi MMI panoramic display and the MMI passenger display, the so-called Digital Stage is a key feature of the interior.","content":" Audi Q6 e-tron with virtual cockpit and MMI Panorama The clearly grouped displays are perfectly integrated into the design concept and give the interior a generous and airy feeling of space. The slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display has a curved design and OLED technology and consists of the 11.9-inch Audi virtual cockpit and the 14.5-inch MMI touch display. The driver\u0026rsquo;s area is designed as a curve and the display with its concave shape is oriented towards the driver. The contours of the curved display are also reminiscent of the single frame typical of Audi. The ambient lighting makes the Curved Display seem to float at night and creates a suitable setting. Especially for the front passengers, Audi complements the digital stage with the 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display with Active Privacy Mode, which prevents it from distracting the driver while on the move. This allows the front passenger to stream films/video content, assist with navigation, or even find a charging station for example.\nWith the optional Augmented Reality Head-Up Display, another central element of the digital stage, Audi is taking a major step forward in display technology. It reflects a large tilted image plane across the windshield towards the driver and shows relevant information such as speed, traffic signs, assistance, and navigation symbols. The image plane is tilted forwards to enhance the augmented reality impression. The focus of the human eye moves with it. This process and the far virtual distance of the image create the impression that the elements shown are floating up to 200 meters (656 ft) away. Virtual content is thus seamlessly integrated into reality.\nThe information can be understood quickly without irritating or distracting the person driving. The field of view of the augmented reality function corresponds to a diagonal of around 88 inches viewed from the driver\u0026rsquo;s position.\nAudi\u0026rsquo;s self-learning voice assistant, the Audi Assistant, can be used to control numerous vehicle functions. The digital assistant with AI support is deeply integrated into the vehicle and, for the first time, is displayed using an avatar in the central touch display of the MMI and in the augmented reality head-up display. The new voice assistant understands more than 800 voice commands. It can also be activated via various touchpoints and via the myAudi app, for example. The voice assistant learns continuously based on user behavior and thus provides support to the person driving. This support can be grouped into three categories: proactive suggestions (context information is used to proactively suggest functions for activation based on this data), smart routines (automatically recognizes recurring operating sequences, such as using the seat climate control from certain outside temperatures) and intelligent lists (such as call lists). The spoken commands are also shown on the display (see-what-you-speak principle). The assistant constantly learns from user behavior and thus supports the driver.\nThe below video shows how the system works\nInfotainment – integrates customers’ digital world The new infotainment system uses Android Automotive OS as its operating system for the first time. Content is always up to date thanks to over-the-air updates. The latest Audi connect services and the enhanced e-tron route planner, included as standard, are therefore always up to date. Apps such as YouTube are available via the store for third-party apps, which is integrated directly into the MMI and does not require a smartphone.\nThe store gives customers access to a wide range of apps. Applications from categories including the following are available at launch: Music, video, gaming, navigation, parking \u0026amp; charging, productivity, weather, and news services. The store is constantly being expanded and the app portfolio is market-specific.\nSee below for more details of the different parts of the HMI (Human Machine Interface).\nMMI Audi Q6 e-tron MMI is based on Android Automotive and have a has serveral screens.

Porsche use it for their upcoming Porsche Macan, while Audi use it for Audi Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron, and others.\nWith its special architecture, it provides the conditions needed for ultra-modern technology that satisfies the demanding customer requests in the full-size and luxury-class segments.\nA6 e-tron PPE will take on the role in the world of electric vehicles that the modular longitudinal platform holds in vehicles powered by combustion engines. It is characterized by a high-tech and highly scalable architecture that allows both low- and high-floor vehicles to be realized.\nPorsche Macan prototype based on PPE Audi is developing various model series based on PPE that will cover the segments from the upper medium-size class to the luxury class as SUVs, Sportbacks, Avants and Crossovers with various different vehicle types.\nIn doing so, the brand is also expanding its current model portfolio in the full-size class and luxury segments by adding numerous electric variants.\nThe diagram below show hows PPE models will be compared to J1 and MEB models in various aspects.\nPPE models compared with J1 and MEB models Battery Like in the Audi e-tron GT, the battery will be 800 volts; in combination with high-efficiency thermal management, it enables a high charging capacity of up to 270 kW.\nAll-electric models based on PPE will be delivered with different battery sizes over time. Audi A6 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron will be delivered with two different configurations when they are launched.\n12 modules with 100 kWh gross (95kWh net) 10 modules with 83.3kWh gross (79kWh net).

For the Audi grandshpere concept Audi uses a PPE platform with 120kWh battery.\nPPE-drivetrain Motors and performance The technology package on the PPE is generally similar to that of the MEB; in addition, it offers great potential in terms of output and performance. As standard, the vehicles are fitted with one electric motor in the rear; the top-of-the-range models are equipped with a second electric motor at the front axle (PSM or ASM) that allows them to activate all-wheel drive automatically when needed.\nIt will of course also be possible to realize different performance levels and battery capacities on the PPE platform.

Balancing means that this cell is now discharged via a resistor and can thereby continue to be charged until all cells have reached the same charge level. This allows the high-voltage battery to achieve its maximum capacitance.\nTo do this, the battery regulation control unit compares the voltages of the cell groups. If cell groups have a high cell voltage, the battery modules control unit responsible receives the balancing information. Balancing is performed when voltage differences of greater than approx. 1% occurs when the high-voltage battery is being charged. After the ignition has been switched off, the battery regulation control unit checks whether balancing is necessary and triggers it if necessary. Typical balancing is performed at charge levels greater than 30%.\nOn all-electric Audis, it is not possible to check the cell balance without extra tools. ODBEleven is one of these tools that can be used. The below screenshot show that one cell set has 10% SOC and another has 13% soc. Audi e-tron has 108 cell sets with 3 or 4 cells in parallel depending on the version.\nCell info from OBDEleven "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron GT interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron GT has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":" The interior of the e-tron GT conveys the ultimate gran turismo feel by radiating sportiness, comfort, and expanse in equal measure. Sustainable materials also play an important part in the electric sports car.\nThe interior: sporty and spacious The strong focus of the interior on the driver – inspired by the “monoposto” concept, a typical design feature of the sporty Audi models – is a characteristic of the e-tron GT. The upper section of the three-dimensional instrument panel is drawn away from the driver in a large, elegant arc. This space is occupied by the display of the Audi virtual cockpit plus, which is shaded by its own cowl. The flat-bottomed steering wheel features multifunction buttons, and its rim can be heated as an option (standard with the RS model ).\nMonoposto concept The center console is tilted toward the driver, and the central MMI touch display is conveniently located in its upper section, where is it easy to see. It is surrounded by a black piano finish bezel that seems to float above the instrument panel and tapers into a wing to the right. When the ambient lighting package plus is on board, the bezel bears a lasered and backlit “e-tron” badge. The standard three-zone automatic air-conditioning is located above the central air vents, where it is easy to reach.\nThe entire instrument panel appears lean and light. It is divided into horizontal levels, creating width and spatial depth. This impression is emphasized effectively in the dark by the ambient lighting package plus with its 30 adjustable colors (standard in the RS model ). The central level spans the entire width of the interior. The lateral air vents underline this sense of width: Aluminum brackets surround their tips that plunge deep into recesses in the door trims. The flowing lines of the door rail visually merge in a straight line into the fender contours of the front section, inspired by the quattro blisters on the exterior.\nThe driver and passenger sit in a sporty low position, separated by the wide center tunnel. The selector switch for the gears, which provides a highly precise haptic control experience, is situated on its console. The rear seats also offer enough space for adults, as their backrests can be folded forward in the ratio 40:20:40. The uncompromisingly high quality and processing of the materials documents the attention to detail with which Audi develops and builds cars.\nSee video for more details.\nSustainable is the new premium: materials, fabrics, colors, and equipment The front seats are available in three designs. Available as standard in the e-tron GT quattro are the sport seats with electric eight-way adjustment and artificial leather/pearl Nappa leather covers. The RS e-tron GT is equipped with sport seats plus with 14-way adjustment, lumbar support and seat heating.\nThe sport seats pro with 18-way adjustment, pneumatic side bolsters, climate control, and (upon request) a massage function are available as an option for both models. In both seat variants, a bezel in the area of the head restraint further sharpens the sporty contour. The seats and steering wheel of the RS model feature special badges, and the pedal caps and footrest are made of stainless steel.\nFor fans with exquisite taste: the design packages The black leather-free design package is available for the sport seats plus. Upholstery is available either as a combination of artificial leather and the Kaskade material or as a mixture of artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica. In both cases, the covers consist predominantly of materials such as polyester fibers that were made from recycled PET bottles, textiles, or residual fibers. Each set of Kaskade covers is made of 119 recycled plastic bottles. Dinamica is a breathable microfiber material made proportionally from recycled polyester fibers and recycled PET. Kaskade is reminiscent of natural fibers such as wool and offers a very pleasant seating feel. The stitching of the seat center panels of both covers is based on the look of the Singleframe.\nRS design package red with carbon inlays and interior lighnting The sport seats pro are made of a combination of two types of leather: fine Nappa leather for the side bolsters and pearl Nappa leather with a perforated honeycomb pattern for the center panels. They are available in black, Santos brown, Arras red, or Monaco gray. The seat colors harmonize with the color-matched interior. In the red and gray RS design packages, red or gray contrasting stitching contrasts with black covers; the seat belts also come in red or gray.\nAudi offers a broad range of upholstery materials, from artificial leather and Dinamica and all the way to full leather, for the upper section of the instrument panel, the steering wheel rim, the door trims, the armrests, and the center console. The floor carpet and floor mats in both models are generally made of Econyl, a material that consists of 100-percent recycled nylon fibers. These fibers are gained from production waste, fabric and carpet remnants, or old fishing nets.\nThe large application area on the instrument panel is painted in a fine paint finish, graphite gray or palladium silver (in the RS model ). Open-pore walnut wood decor or silk-matt carbon with twill are available as alternatives. With the ambient lighting package plus, the “e-tron GT” logo is projected onto the ground when the driver’s door is opened. While aluminum inserts for the door sill trims are standard, the range extends all the way to carbon material with illumination.\nAudi RS e-tron GT with Audi exclusive interior. Photo by Auditography The Audi exclusive program from Audi Sport GmbH fulfills many personal customer requests for equipment, in particular with regard to leather, the stitching, and the seat belts, which are available with colored edges. The cognac/jet gray design package is available as an upscale all-in-one solution. The seats are upholstered with brown fine Nappa leather here, and gray contrasting stitching throughout the interior adds highlights from the steering wheel rim to the floor mats.\nBelow you find all details about the interior options.\nAudi e-tron GT seats Audi e-tron GT have serveral seats options to choose from\nAudi e-tron GT steering wheels Audi e-tron GT have serveral steering wheel options\nHeadliner design You can order the e-tron GT with two different interior headliner colors\nInlays You can choose between different inlays\nInterior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron GT / Audi RS e-tron GT has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\nInterior materials You can select specific interior materials to give Audi e-tron GT a more exclusive look\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has a luxury interior with many options on seats, interior design, interior lights, and many more so that you can personalize the car as you like it.","content":" Audi e-tron interior Below you find the different options.\nAudi e-tron seats and interior materials Audi e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\nAudi e-tron steering wheels Audi e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\nAudi e-tron button styles You can order the Audi e-tron with different button styles\nAudi e-tron headliner design You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors\nAudi e-tron inlays You can choose between different inlays\nAudi e-tron interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\nAudi e-tron S-Line interior S-Line interior gives a sporty look inside from unique S-line options.\nAudi e-tron rear door curtains You can order the e-tron with curtains on the rear door\nStandard door without leather materials You can add interior leather to the car to give it a more exclusive look\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q4-e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi Q4 e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q4 e-tron has a luxury interior with different options in seats and design.","content":" In addition you can select different types of lightning, steeringwheels, interior design.\nAudi Q4 e-tron interior - In Audi Q4 e-tron seats and interior materials Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\nAudi Q4 e-tron steering wheels Audi Q4 e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\nInterior \u0026amp; Ambient lights Audi Q4 e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\nAudi Q4 e-tron Interior Storage Audi Q4 e-tron has lots of storage options inside\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q8-e-tron/interior/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron interior","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q8 e-tron has a luxury interior with many options on seats, interior design, interior lights, and many more so that you can personalize the car as you like it.","content":" Audi Q8 e-tron interior Below you find the different options.\nAudi e-tron seats and interior materials Audi e-tron have serveral seats options to choose from\nAudi e-tron steering wheels Audi e-tron have serveral steering wheel options\nAudi Q8 e-tron button styles You can order the Audi Q8 e-tron with different button styles\nAudi e-tron headliner design You can order the e-tron with two different interior headliner colors\nAudi e-tron inlays You can choose between different inlays\nAudi e-tron interior \u0026amp; ambient lights Audi e-tron has some standard interior lights and some additional options.\nAudi e-tron S-Line interior S-Line interior gives a sporty look inside from unique S-line options.\nAudi e-tron rear door curtains You can order the e-tron with curtains on the rear door\nStandard door without leather materials You can add interior leather to the car to give it a more exclusive look\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/exterior/mirrors/","title":"Audi e-tron GT mirrors","tags":[],"description":"The mirrors can be delivered in 3 different styles and with different functionality.","content":" Functionality Electric adjustable mirrors are standard on Audi e-tron (option ID 6XD).

The Q4 45 e-tron and the Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.\nEntry-level model: the Q4 35 e-tron The entry-level models Audi Q4 35 e-tron are equipped with the compact battery that has a net energy content of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross). An electric motor with an output of 125 kW (170 PS) and torque of 310 Nm provides the drive. In both body variants, it accelerates the electric SUV from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.0 seconds and produces a governed top speed of 160 km/h.

The rear motor generates 150 kW (204 PS) and 310 Nm, the front motor 80 kW (109 PS) and 162 Nm. The electric motors keep reserves available for certain driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output.\nThe full power is only available above 80% SOC. See Performance\nMotor technology While there are three motor configurations there are only two types of electric motors used on Q4 e-tron\nAPP310 - Rear electric motor It is the same rear electric motor on all versions of Q4, but it perform different on Q35 vs Q40/Q45/Q50 because of different battery pack.

For efficiency reasons the front e-axle comes into action only when high power or a strong grip is needed.\nGearbox The powerful APP310 e-drive unit transmits power to the driven wheels using an extremely compact gearbox. The Q4 single gear is able to cope with all driving situations. The mechanism used has only a small number of cogs. This 1-speed gearbox is part of the electric drive system for the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) and is manufactured by Volkswagen Group Components at the Kassel plant.\nAPP310 gearbox Thermal management The motors are liquid cooled.

Another goal of the development in this area was a scalable electric drive system with a high level of component integration. The completely newly developed modular drive system consists of three main components: electric motor, power electronics (pulse inverter), and transmission. All components are characterized by a higher degree of efficiency. They are more compact than the current electric models in the portfolio and have a scalable design. This means that the torque output can be varied by changing the length of the electric motor.\nThe newly developed electric motors also require around 30 percent less installation space than those previously used in Audi\u0026rsquo;s electrically powered models. The new design has also made it possible to reduce the weight by around 20 percent.\nAudi Q6 ASM front motor The particularly compact and efficient electric motors are built in Győr, Hungary. The largest powertrain plant in the world not only manufactures the electric motors but also a large proportion of the gearboxes.\nA key advantage of the newly developed electric motors is their efficiency. This is primarily thanks to a new hairpin winding in the stator, silicon carbide semiconductors in the pulse inverter, as well as dry sump lubrication and an electric oil pump in the transmission. The new hairpin winding, which is being used in the Q6 e-tron2 for the first time at Audi, maximizes the current flow in the stator of the electric motor. This method also enables a higher number of windings: The fill factor is now 60 percent instead of the 45 percent reached with the conventional windings used previously. Thanks to rotor oil cooling, Audi was also able to largely dispense with the use of heavy rare earths and, at the same time, increase the power density by 20 percent. In total, the losses of the electric drives have been significantly reduced by around 50 percent compared to the Audi e-tron.\nAudi Q6 ASM front motor The new direct cooling of the electric motors with oil keeps components such as the stator winding and permanent magnets in the rotor in the optimum temperature range. As a result, the power-to-weight performance of the PPE\u0026rsquo;s electric drive is around 60 percent higher than that of the first-generation electric drives from Audi. The newly developed electric drives for the PPE are also characterized by particularly quiet and comfortable acoustics.\nThis is due in part to unit supports cast onto the housing, a structurally optimized housing, improved tooth geometries, and segmented staggered rotors.\nWhen maximum performance is needed, an asynchronous motor (ASM) on the front axle is activated. It is equipped with its own power electronics and an axle-parallel, two-stage 1-speed gearbox. If required, the ASM can rotate freely without significant drag losses. In addition, no magnets are installed in the ASM, and therefore, no rare earths. The magnetic field is generated by induction. On the rear axle, the Q6 e-tron series is equipped exclusively with particularly compact permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PSM), which are also coupled to a two-stage 1-speed gearbox with an axis-parallel design. The 800-volt technology used in the PPE not only offers high performance and short charging times. The higher voltage also means thinner cables can be used to wire the battery and electric motor. This saves installation space, weight, and raw materials. Another advantage of 800-volt technology is a reduction of heat loss and the resulting lower cooling requirements.\nThanks to the scalability and flexibility of the Premium Platform Electric, a wide range of different performance levels and drive variants can be realized.\nTwo model variants with all-wheel drive and two different performance levels will be available at market launch: the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro2 and the Audi SQ6 e-tron. Particularly efficient models with rear-wheel drive designed for range will follow at a later date - depending on the market - and will also mark the entry into the Q6 e-tron series.\nAudi Q6 PMSM rear motor The Audi Q6 e-tron2 has a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PSM) on the rear axle and an asynchronous motor (ASM) on the front axle. The PSM in the Audi Q6 e-tron2 has an axial length of 200 millimeters. The ASM (asynchronous motor), which spins freely without any significant drag losses, is 100 millimeters (7.9 in) long. The system output is up to 285 kW (387 PS). The Q6 e-tron quattro2. Overall, the efficiency measures relating to the new electric motors for the PPE alone generate around 40 kilometers (25 mi) more range compared to the previous electric model portfolio. The newly developed electric motors for the PPE require around 30 percent less installation space than the units in the first-generation e-tron. The weight has been reduced by around 20 percent.\nAudi Q6 PMSM rear motor The Audi SQ6 e-tron. The PSM on the rear axle has an axial length of 200 millimeters (7.9 in) in the Audi SQ6 e-tron. The ASM on the front axle, which spins freely without any significant drag losses, is 100 millimeters (3.9 in) long and is used in dynamic driving situations. The S model has a maximum range of 598 kilometers (372 mi). The SQ6 e-tron (combined power consumption in kWh/100 km: 18.4-17.5 (WLTP); combined CO2 emissions in g/km: 0; CO2 class A) reaches the 100 km/h (62 mph) mark in as low as 4.3 seconds.\nThe power electronics have a significant influence on power consumption and consequently on efficiency and range. This is why semiconductors made of silicon carbide are being used for the first time in the PPE and, therefore, in the Audi Q6 e-tron2.\nThis material is extremely efficient, particularly under partial load, and heat losses can be kept to a minimum overall. The overall efficiency is improved. In addition, the use of silicon carbide protects the battery.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/exterior/panoramicroof/","title":"Audi e-tron panoramic roof","tags":[],"description":"If you want to stand out in the crowd you can order your e-tron with panoramic roof.","content":" The roof can be openeded.

It is expected to have a world premiere in 2023 and will be the sixth all-electric model from Audi. With a range of up to 700km, it will be the all-electric model with the longest range from Audi.\nMarch 17. 2022 Audi also presented the Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept of this model.\nAudi A6 e-tron and Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept The expectation is that the first owners will receive it in late 2024.\nThis article with subsections presents all known info about this model and will be continued updated when we know more. Join our international Audi A6 e-tron owners group on Facebook to be updated with all the latest info and discuss the car with others.\nExterior, size, and design Even though this is a concept, Audi promises that this concept will look very similar to the production-ready model. At 4.96 meters (16.3 ft.) long, 1.96 meters (6.4 ft.) wide, and 1.44 meters (4.7 ft.) high, its body puts it in the luxury class. Its lines are a consistent development in Audi’s contemporary formal language. Significant elements like the closed Singleframe and the continuous strip of lights in the rear emphasize its kinship with the other electrically powered Audis in the e-tron fleet.\nLarge 22-inch wheels and short overhangs, the flat cabin, and a dynamic roof arch give the Avant proportions that are distinctly reminiscent of a sports car.\nAudi A6 Avant e-tron concept Audi A6 e-tron will be available with S-line exterior, black optics, black windows, virtual mirrors, panoramic roof, several wheels to choose from with sizes from 19\u0026quot; to 22\u0026quot;, many different colors including the possibility for Audi exclusive colors making it possible to create your unique design.\nInterior Audi A6 e-tron will be available with different seat options. From standard seats, sports seats, and comfort seats. Some with the possibility for ventilation and massage. It will also be available with an animal-free interior and a full leather interior with different colors. An s-line interior will also be available.\nDrivetrain Audi A6 e-tron is based on the new PPE-platform that is co-created with Porsche and will come with both 2-wheel drive and quattro versions and with at least two different battery sizes.\nBattery \u0026amp; Range It will be delivered in two battery sizes\n12 modules with 100 kWh gross (94kWh net) 10 modules with 83.3kWh gross (78kWh net). This will give the Audi A6 e-tron a WLTP range of approximately 520-700km depending on the trim level for the biggest battery. (13.4 - 18 kWh/100km)\nThe battery will have an 800-Volt architecture for high-performance charging up to 270KW for DC charging. 300km charging takes as little as 10 minutes.\nMotor and performance Audi A6 e-tron drivetrain The expectation is that the Audi A6 e-tron will come in different versions.\nRear- wheel drive Audi A6 e-tron / Audi A6 Avant e-tron with small battery (45 rating) Rear-wheel drive Audi A6 / Audi A6 Avant e-tron with large battery (the version with longest range)(50 rating) Audi A6 quattro / Audi A6 Avant e-tron quattro with large battery (55 rating) Audi S6 Avant e-tron (60 rating) Audi RS6 Avant e-tron (70 rating) The concept version has 469HP and 800 nm torque. (60 rating)\nAudi will use different motor setups on the different variants.\nSuspension Audi A6 e-tron will be available with Adaptive Air suspension.\nTechnology UI \u0026amp; MMI Audi A6 e-tron will come with a new generation MMI.\nIt will be based on Android Automotive and will feature a larger horizontal display mounted on the dashboard and virtual cockpit.\nLights technology Digital Matrix LED and digital OLED technology make it possible to achieve maximum brightness and a wide range of features even with a minimal surface area, while at the same time offering customizable light signatures. The team of Audi lighting designers and developers has once again done an amazing job – this concept car packs a host of new features and personalization options into its lighting units. Most of them are expected to be available in the production model.\nDigital Matrix with custom light signature Three small, high-resolution LED projectors are built into each side of the body, transforming the ground beneath them into a stage when the doors are opened – small, extended, dynamic lighting effects greet the occupants with messages in their own language.\nThe combination of safety features and aesthetic design is particularly important to Audi. That’s why the small, high-resolution projectors also display warning symbols on the ground – to warn a bike rider that the car door is about to open, for example.\nAnother four high-resolution LED projectors – inconspicuously integrated into the corners of the vehicle – generate turn signal projections. The design of these projections can be modified to address different markets and approval regions as required.\nThe Digital Matrix LED front headlights achieve almost cinematic quality. If, for example, the Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept is parked in front of a wall during a break to recharge the battery, the driver and passengers can pass the time playing a video game projected onto it. Instead of on a small screen in the cockpit, they’ll see their current game’s virtual landscapes projected onto the wall in XXL format – and all this via the Digital Matrix LED headlights.\nDriver Assistance Audi A6 e-tron will be available with different driver assistance packages. Many will be standard while others are options. Systems include Audi Cruise Assist, Audi active lane assist, Audi pre sense, and many many more.\nOptions Audi A6 e-tron will be available with several options. Audi plans to reduce the number of combinations of options. So instead of most options being offered separately like the Audi e-tron, they will introduce options packages.\nAudi A6 e-tron with virtual mirrors Photos \u0026amp; Video See detailed video from @auditography\nAudi A6 e-tron concept Audi A6 e-tron concept Audi A6 e-tron trailer\nAudi A6 e-tron exterior details\nTrailer of the new Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept.\nVideo of drivetrain\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi e-tron GT battery","tags":[],"description":"The lithium-ion battery system of the Audi e-tron GT quattro and the RS e-tron GT can store 83,7 kWh of energy net (93,400 kWh gross).","content":" It integrates 33 cell modules, each of which comprises 12 pouch cells with flexible outer skin.

The cooling elements are glued on underneath the bulkhead plate.\nThe battery housing is secured by means of a steel protective plate. For the battery frame, the developers opted for a lightweight aluminium design. On the one hand, this provides a lot of installation space for the cell modules - and consequently a high battery capacity. On the other hand, this has made it possible for the vehicle weight to be kept low. Modern joining techniques are used such as MIG welding (metal welding with inert gases) on the battery frame, laser welding on the bulkhead and protection plates and heat-conducting adhesive on the line system under the battery (see below).\nAudi e-tron GT battery pack Audi e-tron GT battery pack Audi e-tron GT battery pack Thermal managment Beneath the cell space of the battery, there is a compound structure of flat extruded sections through which a glycol/water mixture flows that circulates in its own low-temperature circuit. The temperature is transferred between the cooling plates and the cell space via a heat-conducting paste. The battery’s feel-good temperature is between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius, and its operating range extends from minus 30 to plus 50 degrees.\nAudi e-tron GT battery cooling circuits Four separate coolant circuits, each at its own temperature level, regulate the temperature in the high-voltage components and the interior precisely and quickly. They can be interconnected flexibly as required. If the driver demands a high output several times in a row, valves couple the coolant circuit of the battery with the refrigerant circuit of the air-conditioning system – this intensive cooling keeps the performance of the drive at a consistently high level. The e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT can accelerate to full speed from a standstill up to ten consecutive times.\nThe refrigerant circuit also helps with cooling during fast DC charging, which can heat the battery up to 50 degrees Celsius. The thermal management is connected to the navigation system. When the driver sets an HPC terminal (High Power Charging) as the destination, the cooling of the battery is already intensified on the way to the charging station so that it can be charged as quickly as possible. Should the battery still be very cold shortly after the car is started in winter, it is heated for fast charging.\nThe standard equipment of the e-tron GT includes a heat pump that heats the interior with the waste heat of the high-voltage components. It can reduce the loss of range that the electric climate control causes in winter in particular significantly. In addition to charging, customers can also manage pre-entry climate control of the interior via their smartphones using the myAudi app. This is done via a powerful high-voltage heating element and does not depend on the car charging via the power grid. Audi equips the e-tron GT with a deluxe auxiliary air-conditioning system as an option that also incorporates the steering wheel rim (if heatable), the exterior mirrors and the rear window.\nReduced power when cold When battery is cold the car reduces the avaialable power to protect the battery. In cold weather you should try to AC charge before leaving home to increase temprature.\nReduced power avaiable in cold weather You can read more about how Audi protects the battery in this article.\nCharging The charging flaps of the gran turismo are located behind the front wheels. Both sides feature connections for alternating current (AC) and there is also a connection for direct current (DC) on the right-hand side. The Audi e-tron GT is delivered to its customers with two charging cables as standard: one mode 3 cable for public AC terminals and the charging system compact for the garage. The e-tron GT can charge with 11 kW AC as standard, which allows it to recharge an empty battery overnight. An optional onboard charger for 22 kW is available.\nAudi e-tron GT chan charge with up to 270kW At a direct current terminal with a voltage of 800 V, for example in the European freeway network from Ionity, the Audi e-tron GT achieves a peak charging capacity of up to 270 kW. This allows it to recharge energy for up to 100 kilometers (62.1 mi) in just over five minutes, and charging from five to 80 percent SoC (state of charge) takes less than 22.5 minutes under ideal conditions. The driver can restrict the charging target in the MMI operating system, for example if the rate appears too high.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/battery/","title":"Audi e-tron battery","tags":[],"description":"The battery on the Audi e-tron is available in two different sizes. 95kWh and 71kWh.","content":" Cell technology Audi/Volkswagen has a multi-vendor strategy on cells.

This ensures that its full power – and therefore the power of the entire drive system – is available after a short time even in extremely cold conditions. Thanks to the stable thermal conditions, the driver can also call on it repeatedly or charge the battery at an HPC charging terminal with high output. The sophisticated thermal management system also gives the battery a long life cycle – Audi guarantees that it will still have at least 70 percent capacity after eight years of operation or after 160,000 kilometers.\nThermal management Audi Q4 e-tron Cooling of the high-voltage battery via the chiller Detail walkthrough of battery Below you see Sandy Munro go in details about the Q4 battery.\nCharging performance Audi Q4 e-tron The first generation of Audi Q4 e-tron had a max charging speed of 100KW for the Q4 e-tron 35 and 125KW for the Audi Q4 e-tron 40/45/50 with the charging curve below.\nCharging curve Q4 e-tron optimal conditions In March 2022, Audi revealed that they upgraded the charging speed and the charging curve for the Audi Q4 e-tron 40/45 and 50.\nAll these cars will now charge up to 135 kW of power.

Simultaneously, the brand with the four rings is consolidating new skills and technologies at its company headquarters with the assembly of the newly developed high-voltage (HV) battery for the Premium Platform Electric (PPE). Thanks to the new battery assembly, Audi is gradually increasing the vertical range of manufacture for fully electric models and gathering experience for battery module production further down the line.\nAs part of the production of the Audi Q6 e-tron series, approximately 1,000 high-voltage (HV) batteries are assembled every day on an area of around 30,000 square meters. A total of about 300 employees work in battery assembly in three shifts. The automation rate rises to about 90 percent. For each high-voltage battery, the manufacturing time falls from about two hours to only 55 minutes. Compared to the battery systems Audi has used to date, the battery for the PPE consists of only twelve modules with a total of 180 prismatic cells. For comparison: The HV battery in the Q8 e-tron is made up of 36 modules and 432 cells. The significant enlargement of the cells corresponds closely to the system voltage of 800 volts to achieve the best possible balance between range and charging performance.\n100Kwh gross pack, 12 modules For the PPE, the ratio of nickel to cobalt and manganese in the cells is approximately 8:1:1, with a reduced proportion of cobalt and an increased proportion of nickel, which is of particular importance for the energy density.\nThe reduction of the number of modules for the PPE batteries offers a range of advantages. The battery, which can be used modularly for high-floor and flat-floor models, requires less installation space, is lighter, and can be integrated into the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s crash structure and cooling system better. It also requires fewer cables and high-voltage connectors. The number of bolted fastenings has been significantly reduced. Additionally, the electrical connections between the modules are shorter, which substantially reduces losses and weight. A cooling plate integrated into the battery housing ensures homogeneous heat transfer and therefore near-optimal battery conditioning. The protective side skirts made of hot-formed steel are not affixed to the battery, but instead attached very securely to the body. The underbody cladding made of fiber composite material is also new. This construction further reduces weight and improves the thermal insulation between the battery and the environment. This allows the PPE\u0026rsquo;s battery to be heated or cooled more efficiently.\nBattery capacity 100 kWh and charging power up to 270 kW The HV battery for the PPE was developed from the ground up and its structure was simplified. It is equipped with twelve modules and 180 cells and has a gross storage capacity of 100 kWh (94.9 net). For each module, 15 electrochemical cells are connected in series. The maximum charging power for the 100 kWh battery is 270 kW.\nBattery module with 15 x 152 ah cells A variant with a capacity of 83 kWh is also available for the Audi Q6 e-tron series. The latter consists of ten modules and 150 cells. Thanks to optimized cell chemistry and high-performance thermal management, the 100 kWh battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 21 minutes at a suitable fast-charging station. Recharging a range up to 255 kilometers (158 mi) is possible in only ten minutes.\nThe battery management controller (BMC), a central control unit developed specifically for the PPE, is responsible for the current control required for fast and battery-saving charging. The BMC is completely integrated in the HV battery. As part of a permanent monitoring, the twelve cell module controllers (CMS) send data such as the current module temperature or the cell voltage to the BMC, which sends its information, for example regarding the state of change (SoC), to the HCP 4 high-performance computer (part of the new E3 1.2 electronic architecture). This computer, in turn, sends data to the new predictive thermal management, which regulates the cooling or heating circulation as needed for optimal battery performance.\nIf a charging station is working with 400-volt technology, bank-charging is possible for the first time. The 800-volt battery is automatically divided into two batteries at equal voltage, which can then be charged in parallel with up to 135 kW. Both halves of the battery are first brought to the same level of charge and then charged together.\nBattery module with 15 x 152 ah cells Efficient thermal management for shorter charging time, more range, and longer service life Intelligent thermal management provides an essential contribution to the high charging performance and long service life of the HV battery in the PPE. The most important component is predictive thermal management, which uses data from the navigation, the route, the departure timer, and the customer\u0026rsquo;s usage behavior to calculate the need for cooling or heating in advance, as well as to provide them both efficiently and at the right time. If a customer is driving to an HPC charging station included in the planned route, the predictive thermal management prepares the DC charging process and cools or heats the battery so that it can charge faster, thus reducing charging time.\nIf there is a steep grade ahead, the thermal management adjusts the HV battery’s temperature by appropriate cooling to prevent a higher thermal stress.\nIf the customer provides no information from which predictive data can be derived, a standard algorithm regulates the HV battery\u0026rsquo;s thermal management. This algorithm also collects a great deal of information and reacts to the driving situation. If, for example, the driver has selected efficiency mode in the drive select menu, the conditioning of the battery is activated later and the real range can be increased depending on driving behavior. In dynamic mode, the goal is optimal performance. However, if the current traffic situation does not allow for dynamic driving, the thermal management will react to this and minimize the energy usage for battery conditioning.\nPost-conditioning and continuous conditioning are also new in the PPE thermal management. These functions monitor the battery temperature for the car’s entire service life so the battery is kept in the optimal temperature range even when the vehicle is not moving – for example in case of hot outside temperatures. This measure also contributes to extended battery service life.\nDue to high temperature homogeneity within the battery, performance can be increased - which is why the coolant is directed below the modules according to the U-flow principle. The battery cooling plate is also a structural component of the battery, which allows an additional floor panel in the HV space of the battery housing to be eliminated and the thermal connection to the modules to be optimized using a heat-conducting paste.\nCharging curve Below is the charging curve for 100 kWh battery.

On the Audi e-tron, there are three ways to recuperate energy:\nAutomatic recuperation When recuperation mode is automatic, the car will decide when to recuperate when the driver is not accelerating or using adaptive cruise assist.\nWhen the car enters a zone that enforces a lower speed or when it comes up behind a slower car in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce speed by coasting.\nIf the distance available is too short, it switches to coasting recuperation up to 0.15 g.\nThe predictive efficiency assist system must be activated in the Audi e-tron for automatic recuperation to cut in.\nWhen braking, the motor at the rear alone performs the deceleration in most everyday driving situations.\nManual recuperation via the paddle levers On the steering wheel, the Audi e-tron has paddle levers to set recuperation in three different levels manually The levels are\nOff Level 1 approx 0.06G Level 2 approx 0.15G Depending on which recuperation mode is enabled, the regen level will be remembered or turned off if the accelerator is pressed.\nSetting it to manual and using paddles to set it to Level 1 or Level 2 will enable one-pedal-driving.\nBrake pedal recuperation Depending on the battery’s charge level and the driving situation, a deceleration of approximately 0.3 g can be generated by brake energy recuperation.\nOn average, over 90 percent of all braking deceleration is below 0.3 g, depending on the driving style and the driving situation. This allows a large amount of the kinetic energy during braking to be returned to the battery via brake energy recuperation.\nThe transition between brake energy recuperation (electrical deceleration) and deceleration using the hydraulic brake system is seamless and is not felt by the driver.\nThis is made possible by sophisticated and precise regulation with the new electrohydraulic brake regulation system MK C1.\nOn e-tron 55 and 50, the recuperation can reach 220kW depending on speed.

For example, in gear B (brake), the drive almost always recuperates when coasting but not when the car is at a standstill.\nThe regen braking limit is at 0.15 g of deceleration. If “dynamic” mode is set in the optional Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard in the Sportback), recuperation also occurs in gear D.\nThe optional shift paddles on the steering wheel enable the driver to select three different manual recuperation levels in position D – 0.06 g, 0.10 g, and 0.15 g. The car will remember the regen level in dynamic mode after using the throttle. In other drive select modes, the regen level will reset to 0 after using the throttle.\nThe driver can also choose automatic recuperation in the MMI system. When the car enters a zone that enforces a lower speed or when it comes up behind a slower car in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce speed by coasting.\nIf the distance available is too short, it switches to coasting recuperation up to 0.10 g.\nThe predictive efficiency assist system must be activated in the Audi Q4 e-tron for automatic recuperation to cut in. When braking, the PSM motor at the rear alone performs the deceleration in most everyday driving situations.\nThe quattro models, Audi Q4 e-tron 45/50, can brake electrically at up to almost 0.3 g, equivalent to a recuperation performance of up to 145 kW. The electric brake booster only activates the hydraulic wheel brakes if more significant deceleration is required. The transition between regeneration and physical brakes is almost unnoticeable. The recuperation remains active almost until the vehicle is at a standstill.\nThe quattro models prioritize recuperation on the rear axle but also use the front electric motor in a few situations.\nAudi Q4 e-tron physical brakes Audi uses disk brakes for the front wheels.\nFront brake On the rear wheels it uses drum brakes.\nRear brake "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q6-e-tron/drivetrain/brakes/","title":"Audi Q6 e-tron brakes &amp; recuperation","tags":[],"description":"The Audi Q6 e-tron uses an electrohydraulically integrated brake control system.","content":" "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q8-e-tron/drivetrain/brakes/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron brakes &amp; recuperation","tags":[],"description":"The Audi Q8 e-tron uses an electrohydraulically integrated brake control system.","content":" Regenerative brakes With its recuperation concept, the Audi Q8 e-tron can recover most of the kinetic energy during braking (recuperation– electric motors in generator mode) and significantly increase range, depending on the topography. On the Audi Q8 e-tron, there are three ways to recuperate energy:\nAutomatic recuperation When recuperation mode is automatic, the car will decide when to recuperate when the driver is not accelerating or using adaptive cruise assist.\nWhen the car enters a zone that enforces a lower speed or when it comes up behind a slower car in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce speed by coasting.\nIf the distance available is too short, it switches to coasting recuperation up to 0.15 g.\nThe predictive efficiency assist system must be activated in the Audi Q8 e-tron for automatic recuperation to cut in.\nWhen braking, the motor at the rear alone performs the deceleration in most everyday driving situations.\nManual recuperation via the paddle levers On the steering wheel, the Audi Q8 e-tron has paddle levers to set recuperation in three different levels manually The levels are\nOff Level 1 approx 0.06G Level 2 approx 0.15G Depending on which recuperation mode is enabled, the regen level will be remembered or turned off if the accelerator is pressed.\nSetting it to manual and using paddles to set it to Level 1 or Level 2 will enable one-pedal-driving.\nBrake pedal recuperation Depending on the battery’s charge level and the driving situation, a deceleration of approximately 0.3 g can be generated by brake energy recuperation.\nOn average, over 90 percent of all braking deceleration is below 0.3 g, depending on the driving style and the driving situation. This allows a large amount of the kinetic energy during braking to be returned to the battery via brake energy recuperation.\nThe transition between brake energy recuperation (electrical deceleration) and deceleration using the hydraulic brake system is seamless and is not felt by the driver.\nThis is made possible by sophisticated and precise regulation with the new electrohydraulic brake regulation system MK C1.\nOn e-tron 55 and 50, the recuperation can reach 220kW depending on speed.

The ambiance in the interior was designed to be decidedly homely. The “Softwrap” extends from the doors across the entire cockpit to the center console, creating a homogeneous and enveloping feeling of space. The same colors and high-quality materials, some of which are made from recycled materials, can also be found in the seats. For example, the S line variant\u0026rsquo;s Softwrap uses the recycled fabric Elastic Melange, which is made from 100 percent recycled polyester. The headlining, lining of the pillars, and the sun visors are made from Draft fabric, which is also 100 percent recycled polyester.\nAudi offers the Argument fabric for the normal and sports seats. The sports seats with contrasting stitching (KN) are also optionally available in Elastic Melange fabric. In the S line and S model, the sports seat plus is optionally available in Dinamica microfiber, also a recycled material, or in fine Nappa leather with diamond quilting. Dinamica also adorns the door mirror. Although this fabric looks and feels like suede, almost half of it is made from recycled polyester, which comes from textile waste.\nThe application surfaces on the instrument panel are painted in volcano gray fine lacquer as standard. Alternatively, sweetgum natural in light brown, or birch linear natural in stone grey wood or matt brushed aluminum in anthracite can be ordered. Birch linear is a technically jointed veneer, i.e., a laminated wood that is cut into veneers and made from locally grown and FSC/PEFC-certified birch wood. This resource-saving process also produces less waste.\nIn the S line version and the S model, customers can choose a technical fabric in anthracite in addition to matt brushed aluminum in anthracite and open-pored carbon micro twill. The latter is an innovative, technical-looking polyester fabric with recycled content that is characterized by a tactile structure and a new look.\nThe materials used were selected from a functional point of view and at the same time ensure a clear design differentiation of the various vehicle areas in the interior. Comfort-oriented areas are designed with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control surfaces in high-quality, high-gloss black emphasize the clarity of interaction.\nInterior packages Audi has created some interior packages that combines seats and material sections for seats and interior.\nPackage Interior SQ6 Specific features in the interior are reserved for the SQ6 e-tron, for example, the red ring around the start/stop button, the diamond with the S lettering in the seat, or S-specific displays in the MMI as well as black-painted brake calipers with S lettering on the exterior, the exterior mirror housing in Unique Chrome Silver, bumpers with aluminum inserts, the S sports suspension, and the e-tron sports sound with S tuning.\nInterior space Thanks to the new Premium Platform Electric, which was developed specifically for e-mobility, the vehicle also has a generous feeling of space and roominess as well as a high level of everyday usability. The package of this SUV, in particular, has been specially designed to meet the needs of SUV customers. The interior offers plenty of storage space and stowage compartments. In the center console, there are two cup holders, a wireless cell phone charger, and a storage compartment below the center armrest with more than five liters (0.17 cu ft) of storage space. The greater comfort in the second row of seats is typical of an electric car without a center tunnel. The trunk offers 526 liters (18.6 cu ft) of storage space. If the rear seat bench is folded down, the storage space increases to up to 1,529 liters (54 cu ft). The rear seats can be folded down separately (40:20:40).

The e-tron GT quattro accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 4.1 seconds; the RS model achieves this in just 3.3 seconds.","content":" Both values apply for boost with launch control, which the driver can access in “dynamic” mode of the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. The RS model reaches the 200 km/h (124.3 mph) mark in 10.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). The e-tron GT quattro has a top speed of 245 km/h (152.2 mph).\nIn the e-tron GT quattro, the front electric motor outputs 175 kW (238 PS), and the rear motor outputs 320 kW (435 PS). Both electric motors keep reserves available for extreme driving situations, which is why the sum of their individual outputs exceeds the drive’s total output of 350 kW (476 PS) considerably. Up to 390 kW (530 PS) are available for roughly 2.5 seconds in boost mode via launch control. The total torque is 630 Nm (464.7 lb-ft). In the RS e-tron GT, the electric motor at the front axle also outputs 175 kW (238 PS), while the motor in the rear outputs 335 kW (456 PS). The total output is 440 kW (598 PS), and the total torque is 830 Nm (612.2 lb-ft). In boost mode, the output briefly increases to 475 kW (646 PS).\nFront electric motor with suspension Rear electric motor with suspension More copper in the stator: the hairpin winding The PSM motors (permanently excited synchronous motors) in the e-tron GT are extremely efficient, with an efficiency of considerably more than 90 percent in the majority of all driving situations. They are produced with a complex technology known as hairpin winding. The coils of the stator consist of rectangular copper wires that look similar to hairpins after they have been bent. This allows the wires to be packed more tightly, as a result of which considerably more copper fits into the stator as compared to the conventional round winding. This increases the output and torque and makes the cooling of the electric motors, which takes place via a separate medium-temperature circuit, more efficient.\nAudi e-tron GT electric motor with hairpin winding The electric motor, the power electronics, and the transmission form a compact block on both axles. The front motor is installed coaxially and has a ratio of 8.1:1. The rear electric motor is installed parallel to the axles and sends its torque to a two-speed transmission with three shafts. The second gear (ratio of 8.2:1) provides excellent efficiency and also large amounts of reserve power. The first gear, which has a very short ratio of 15.6:1, ensures spirited acceleration right from the start, if the driver so desires. If the driver decides against this, the car moves off in first gear. The driver generally does not need to press a start button to drive off and can just depress the brake pedal and engage the “D” or “R” gear. As soon as they take their foot off the brake pedal, the car starts to roll at low speed.\nThe new generation of quattro: the electric all-wheel drive The electric all-wheel drive in the e-tron GT quattroand RS e-tron GT regulates the drive torque distribution between the axles – continuously, fully variably, and within a few thousandths of a second. The electric gran turismo thus offers powerful dynamism and optimum traction in any weather conditions. The quattro principle of the four-wheel drive that Audi introduced to the market more than 40 years ago presents itself on a new, fascinating technological level.\nWhen the e-tron GT is being driven in the “comfort” mode of Audi drive select, both electric motors work together in the most energy-conserving way possible. In “dynamic” mode, its character is more rear-heavy, while “efficiency” mode clearly prioritizes front-wheel drive. With a slippery road surface, high power requirements, or fast cornering, more torque can be distributed to the rear wheels – and around five times faster than with a mechanical quattro drivetrain.\nEfficiency takes priority: coasting or recuperation When the driver releases the right-hand pedal, the drive of the e-tron GT generally switches to coasting. This strategy prevents the losses associated with every conversion of energy. The large gran turismo glides calmly and efficiently while its electric motors run along virtually deenergized. Coasting recuperation takes place at the front electric motor and only in the “dynamic” mode of Audi drive select.\nRegardless of the driving mode, the driver can use the rocker switches on the steering wheel to adjust two manual recuperation levels of different strengths. They can select an automatic level in the MMI system, where the rocker switches are non-functional. In this case, the predictive efficiency assist regulates coasting and recuperation on the basis of data which is obtains from the navigation system and the onboard sensors. For example, when the car is approaching a roundabout or a slower car driving in front, the drive management system attempts to reduce the speed by coasting. If the available distance is too short, it switches to recuperation. In this case, maximum deceleration is slightly higher than in the manual recuperation levels, reaching up to 0.13 g.\nBrake recuperation: output of up to 265 kW While braking, the electric motors perform decelerations alone up to around 0.3 g, i.e. the vast majority of all brake applications in everyday driving. The hydraulic wheel brakes are activated only when the driver brakes very heavily. The transition is almost unnoticeable, and recuperation remains active almost up to a standstill. If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 265 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the gran turismo remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi e-tron electric motors &amp; setup","tags":[],"description":"Audi e-tron has powerful electric motors and was the first EV to have a tri-motor configuration.

If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 275 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the Audi e-tron remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\nDifferential and electric torque vectoring In addition to electric all-wheel drive, Audi e-tron S are equipped with electric torque vectoring:\nFor reasons relating to efficiency, the rear electric motors in the Audi e-tron S and e-tron S Sportback provide propulsion when driving normally. The front electric motor is deenergized, but flashes into action when the driver demands more output, or predictively before slip occurs when driving on slippery roads or cornering at high speed. This electric all-wheel drive is now being enhanced with electric torque vectoring at the rear axle: Each of the two electric motors send their torques directly to the wheel via a transmission; there is no longer a mechanical differential.\nThanks to the spontaneity of the electric motors, electric torque vectoring, that is the distribution of the torque between the rear wheels, takes place within milliseconds. The time offset as compared to a mechanical system is shorter by a factor of four. It can also manage considerably higher torque: When the driver accelerates out of a corner at a sporty speed, the outside rear wheel is subject to 220 Nm (162.3 lb-ft) more than the inside wheel. Due to the gear ratio, the difference at the wheels is around 2,100 Nm (1,548.9 lb-ft). The yaw moment that is generated supports the steering characteristics and the curve radius can be retained with a smaller steering angle. Electric torque vectoring also offers great strengths in terms of pure traction: If one of the rear wheels is on very slippery ground during acceleration, e.g. a patch of ice or gravel, it receives no torque. Almost all of the torque is transferred to the wheel that has stronger traction.\nA prerequisite for the high speed and precision with which the electric all-wheel drive and the electric torque vectoring work is the close linking of the following control units: the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC), the drive control unit (ASG), the electronic chassis platform (ECP), and the control units of the performance electronics, which output voltage pulses up to 10,000 times per second. All software functions, apart from the ESC, are Audi in-house developments that benefit from the brand’s roughly 40 years of quattro experience.\nThe ECP is the mastermind among the control units: It makes the crucial contribution to the management of the all-wheel drive and electric torque vectoring. It calculates the ideal distribution of longitudinal and transverse torque on the basis of the data from the sensors that continuously inform it on the car’s driving condition and the driver’s request. One of its tasks is wheel-selective torque control: At the dynamic limit, the unloaded front wheel on the inside of the curve is braked slightly via the wheel brake. This minor, almost unnoticeable intervention prevents slip and makes handling even more agile and neutral.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q8-e-tron/drivetrain/motor/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron electric motors &amp; setup","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q8 e-tron has powerful electric motors both in twin and tri-motor configuration.

The hydraulic wheel brakes are activated only when the driver brakes very heavily. The transition is almost unnoticeable, and recuperation remains active almost up to a standstill. If both electric motors are involved in brake recuperation in order to ensure handling stability, they can recover up to 275 kW of power. In all driving situations – be it full acceleration, dynamic handling, coasting or brake recuperation – the Audi e-tron remains unshakably stable because its control systems for brakes, suspension, drive, and power electronics are closely connected and work together quickly.\nDifferential and electric torque vectoring In addition to electric all-wheel drive, Audi e-tron S are equipped with electric torque vectoring:\nFor reasons relating to efficiency, the rear electric motors in the Audi e-tron S and e-tron S Sportback provide propulsion when driving normally. The front electric motor is deenergized, but flashes into action when the driver demands more output, or predictively before slip occurs when driving on slippery roads or cornering at high speed. This electric all-wheel drive is now being enhanced with electric torque vectoring at the rear axle: Each of the two electric motors send their torques directly to the wheel via a transmission; there is no longer a mechanical differential.\nThanks to the spontaneity of the electric motors, electric torque vectoring, that is the distribution of the torque between the rear wheels, takes place within milliseconds. The time offset as compared to a mechanical system is shorter by a factor of four. It can also manage considerably higher torque: When the driver accelerates out of a corner at a sporty speed, the outside rear wheel is subject to 220 Nm (162.3 lb-ft) more than the inside wheel. Due to the gear ratio, the difference at the wheels is around 2,100 Nm (1,548.9 lb-ft). The yaw moment that is generated supports the steering characteristics and the curve radius can be retained with a smaller steering angle. Electric torque vectoring also offers great strengths in terms of pure traction: If one of the rear wheels is on very slippery ground during acceleration, e.g. a patch of ice or gravel, it receives no torque. Almost all of the torque is transferred to the wheel that has stronger traction.\nA prerequisite for the high speed and precision with which the electric all-wheel drive and the electric torque vectoring work is the close linking of the following control units: the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC), the drive control unit (ASG), the electronic chassis platform (ECP), and the control units of the performance electronics, which output voltage pulses up to 10,000 times per second. All software functions, apart from the ESC, are Audi in-house developments that benefit from the brand’s roughly 40 years of quattro experience.\nThe ECP is the mastermind among the control units: It makes the crucial contribution to the management of the all-wheel drive and electric torque vectoring. It calculates the ideal distribution of longitudinal and transverse torque on the basis of the data from the sensors that continuously inform it on the car’s driving condition and the driver’s request. One of its tasks is wheel-selective torque control: At the dynamic limit, the unloaded front wheel on the inside of the curve is braked slightly via the wheel brake. This minor, almost unnoticeable intervention prevents slip and makes handling even more agile and neutral.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron-gt/technology/soundsystem/","title":"Audi e-tron GT soundsystem","tags":[],"description":"You can choose between two different sound systems on Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT","content":" Audi sound system The standard sound system is a 150 Watt 6 channel system with 10 speakers including center speaker and subwoofer.\nOptionId 9VD\nStandard door speakers Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound The Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen Sound System with 3D sound offers a fascinating feature for hi-fi fans – sound that includes the spatial dimension of height.

But this is not the case on Audi e-tron.\nThe diagram below show how this is adjusted depending on speed.\nAdjustment of adaptive air suspension in different modes The illustration shows the control strategy for the air suspension systems. By selecting the preferred driving mode in Audi drive select, the driver determines the vehicle’s ride height and dynamic characteristics. At the same time, different ride heights are also automatically set within the selected driving mode, depending on the current vehicle speed. An example of this can be seen in the control strategy when “auto” mode is selected: If the vehicle is currently set to a different ride height, the normal level is set by changing the volume of air in the air springs if the mode is selected when the vehicle is stationary or travelling at a speed below 120 km/h.\nIf the vehicle subsequently exceeds a speed of 120 km/h, the ride height will immediately be lowered by 13 mm to low level 1. If the speed then increases further to at least 140 km/h and remains there for 20 seconds, the ride height will be lowered again by a further 13 mm to motorway level.

Experts tune them in line with the familiar Audi DNA in order to create a high level of emotionality and the premium experience typical of Audi.\nThe partially redesigned front axle has a significant influence on the driving dynamics of the Audi Q6 e-tron. For the first time in an Audi model, the control arms are arranged in front of the suspension arms in the direction of travel. This results, above all, in package advantages in favor of the arrangement of the high-voltage battery\nAudi Q6 front suspension with standard comfort suspension Audi Q6 front suspension with adaptive air suspension The newly developed components lead to improved kinematic properties. The steering is now bolted to a subframe. The refined axle kinematics provide noticeably more driving dynamics. The new front axle also improves the steering behavior. This makes the vehicle appear significantly more agile. The stiffened torsion bar in the steering also contributes to increased steering precision. New software modules in the steering, as well as modified caster sections, further optimize the steering feedback and, thus, the steering feel.\nWith the combination of the new passive damping system FSD (Frequency Selective Damping) and the more agile front axle, the Audi Q6 e-tron is even more capable on road. The FSD reduces damping forces, particularly at high frequencies, for example, on cobblestones, and maintains high damping forces at low frequencies, such as those that occur when changing lanes or cornering. The adaptive air suspension - the air suspension with controlled damping - gives the vehicle a wide spread between smooth ride comfort and sporty handling. Depending on the speed and the driver\u0026rsquo;s wishes, it adapts individually to the road conditions and regulates the ride height at different levels. The air suspension also offers level control for different load conditions.\nAudi Q6 front suspension with standard comfort suspension Audi Q6 front suspension with adaptive air suspension The central chassis control unit, the Electronic Chassis Platform (ECP), regulates the operation of the dampers individually for each wheel every millisecond - depending on the road surface, the driving style, and the mode selected in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. Electromagnetic damper valves vary the flow of the hydraulic fluid. The optional electronically controlled, adaptive air suspension with continuously adjustable damping system on all four wheels automatically regulates the vehicle level and damping. This gives the electric SUV high ride comfort on the one hand but also offers enhanced driving dynamics on the other. Various modes, including level control and manual lifting function on all four wheels and lowering function on the rear axle, are set via Audi drive select. Depending on the mode selected, the vehicle is lowered by up to 30 millimeters (1.2 in) depending on the speed. Lowering the rear axle (minus 50 millimeters (2 in), activated by a button in the luggage compartment) makes it easier to access the luggage compartment and hitch up a trailer.\nThe normal level of the adaptive air suspension is 28 millimeters (1.1 in) lower than the level of the standard comfort suspension.\nThe rear-biased , highly variable all-wheel drive sysgem also enhances the dynamic driving characteristics of the Audi Q6 e-tron. The different dimensions of the electric motors on the rear and front axles enable rear-biased torque distribution even under full load. The rear tires of the Audi Q6 e-tron are wider than the front tires to accommodate the rear-biased weight distribution - for even more grip and better driving dynamics.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/q8-e-tron/drivetrain/suspension/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron suspension","tags":[],"description":"Audi Q8 e-tron has adaptive air supsension.","content":" Adaptive air suspension with electronic damping control is standard equipment on the Audi e-tron.

Between 50 (31.1 mph) and 80 km/h (49.7 mph), depending on the driving situation, there is a continuous transition between a steering angle in opposite directions and a steering angle in the same direction.

Its compressor generates a working pressure of up to 19 bar, and the three-chamber air suspension on the front and rear axles enables comfortable basic suspension. The chambers in the bellows are activated and deactivated depending on the driving situation. During smooth driving, all three of them contribute to the suspension, while only one or two chambers are active in the case of dynamic requirements such as heavy braking or high transverse acceleration – this strategy reduces the movement of the body.\n3 chamber air suspension The air suspension can adjust the body to different heights. It lowers the body by up to 10 millimeters (0.4 in) at a speed of 90 km/h (55.9 mph), and by another 12 millimeters (0.5 in) at 180 km/h (111.8 mph). When driving at a speed below 30 km/h (18.6 mph), the driver can set a lift mode that raises the body by 20 millimeters (0.8 in), for example when driving into underground parking garages. The adaptive air suspension works closely together with the controlled dampers (standard) that adjust to the circumstances at millisecond intervals. Both systems are managed by a central control unit, the electronic chassis platform (ECP). This connection ensures maximum precision.\n3 chamber air suspension The below diagram shows the different ride levels depending on settings and speed with air suspension\nRidelevel Audi e-tron GT with adaptive air suspension Four driving modes: Audi drive select In the Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard), the driver can specify how the dampers, electric motors, two-speed transmission, and controlled rear-axle differential lock are to operate. They can switch between the “comfort,” “efficiency,” “dynamic,” and “individual” modes via a physical switch. In “efficiency” mode, the body is lowered to the low level to promote better airflow and the top speed is limited to 140 km/h (87.0 mph); however, the driver can override this limit by stepping heavily on the accelerator pedal. In “dynamic” mode, the electric all-wheel drive, the suspension systems, and the active aerodynamics are set to a sporty mode.\nDrive Select menu For dynamic handling: rear-axle differential lock The controlled rear-axle differential lock, which is integrated in the ECP control operations, is available as standard with the RS e-tron GT and as part of the dynamic package option with the e-tron GT.

Still many experience slower charging speed than expected. Why is that?","content":"First. What is the expected charging rate? Under optimal conditions, the charge curve will look like this.\nThat means that you often see 150kW up to 80% and 100kW to 85% and still above 50kW at 100%. This makes the Audi e-tron one of the fastest charging cars on the market.\nBut people may see that their charging speed is much slower than this.\nReason 1. Cold battery The most common reason for reduced charging speed is that the battery is cold. The ideal battery temperature is about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for maximum charging performance.\nWhen the battery temperature is cold, the chemistry in the battery is not able to receive the same amount of energy, and the charging speed is reduced.\nHow to prevent it? On the Audi e-tron, there is not much you can do while driving except drive longer before you charge or harder that increases the temperature. On other models like Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT the car heats the battery if navigation is set to a High Power Charger.\nReason 2. Shared infrastructure On some chargers there is a shared infrastructure and if many charges at the same time, the speed is reduced for each charger.\nReason 3.

The reason is that in B-mode you will be ending up recuperating when not needed and that will lose energy during the conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy on the battery. Around 80% of the kinetic energy is put into the battery while recuperating. If you coast you will keep that energy as kinetic energy.\nTo be able to coast in B-mode you would need to hold foot on the throttle on a specific location, but even the best driver will not be able to shift between driving and coasting at the same speed as in D-mode.\nOn other cars, B-mode would be more efficient, but Audi has created blended brakes that always do recuperate when pressing the brake pedal if possible. That\u0026rsquo;s why you don\u0026rsquo;t waste energy using the brake pedal on the Audi Q4 e-tron.\nAudi Q4 e-tron power meter showing B mode Note: If “dynamic” mode is set in the optional Audi drive select dynamic handling system (standard in the Sportback), recuperation also takes place in gear D but at a slightly weaker rate than in B.\nHow much does it matter? Even D-mode is the most efficient in most cases the differences could be ignored. If you prefer driving with B-mode in the city (one-pedal-driving) you should just do it. The extra range you get from D-mode in the city driving probably is not something you would care about.\nOn high-way it is much more comfortable to use D-mode in addition to being more efficient.\nWant to learn more Read our one-pedal driving guide.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/models/e-tron/knowledgeexchange/faq/","title":"Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQ)","tags":[],"description":"We have collected frequently asked questions about Audi e-tron and try to answer them for you.","content":"Charging Why is my Audi e-tron charging speed much slower than expected myAudi App Why I am not able to control my car throug myAudi?

But here are some of the most common issues and solutions\nLog in and log out In some cases, and especially when you get an error message about the action can\u0026rsquo;t be performed because some other action is happening you should try to log out and log in again.\nRemove car from myAudi This option can help if you have never been able to connect to the car. Removing it from MyAudi, adding it again with VIN, and then requesting Audi to add you as the main user.\nBad network coverage where it is parked Even if you are standing 10 meters away from the car, the communication will always go through central Audi servers. If there is bad reception for the car it might not be online. The car might use another network than your cells. Depending on country and provider.\nCommon server or software issue The most common issue is that Audi servers or software have issues that prevent owners to access functionality. This happens often in winter when more users try to heat the car.\nContact Audi Digital Support\nReset of car For some owners, their dealership has disconnected the car from the 12-volt battery and in that way resetting the communication module.\nReplacement of SOS module In some cases, the communication module (SOS module) needs to be replaced.

Below you see some examples of ranges posted by users in different social media groups.\nWhy does the car estimate this range? The range indicator base its range on the following data\nAverage consumption on the last 100km/62 miles driven The state of charge (of much is the battery charged) The planned route in the navigation system So assume you have an e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery and you have charged it to 100%.\nIf you check the driving data in myAudi app on short-term memory you will see your drives.\nIf we calculate the range based on the consumption on 24.12 with 30.3 kWh/100km we get\n86.5/30.3 = 285km.\nSame calculation based in miles 2.1mi/kWh\n86.5*2.1 = 181 miles.\nBut this is the best guess based on previous trips. If you change behavior on the next trip, the range calculated would be wrong.\nIf you have done many short trips in cold weather, you would have spent lots of energy to heat up the car. But this average consumption is not relevant if you the next day are taking a long drive. The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\nThe numbers do not match up, can it be something wrong? If your average consumption on our last trip does not match up with the estimated range it might be a problem with your Audi e-tron.\nWe have seen examples of defects that cause low range.\nThe first you should try is to calculate the battery capacity so you are sure there is a problem. This would also make it easier for you to document this for your dealer.\nRead this guide to calculate and verify your Audi e-tron battery status\nIf your conclusion is that the battery capacity is much lower of the specified capacity it might be one of the following problems.

The car would then underestimate the range.\nIf a route is defined in the car navigation system the car would adjust range based on elevation and road ahead.\nThe below table show the calculated range based on different average consumption for and Audi Q4 40/45/50 with 76.6kWh available battery.\nconsumption kWh/100 consumption miles/kWh Calculated range km Calculated range miles 15 4,1 511 317 15,5 4,0 494 307 16 3,9 479 298 16,5 3,8 464 289 17 3,7 451 280 17,5 3,6 438 272 18 3,5 426 264 18,5 3,4 414 257 19 3,3 403 251 19,5 3,2 393 244 20 3,1 383 238 20,5 3,0 374 232 21 3,0 365 227 21,5 2,9 356 221 22 2,8 348 216 22,5 2,8 340 212 23 2,7 333 207 23,5 2,6 326 203 24 2,6 319 198 24,5 2,5 313 194 25 2,5 306 190 25,5 2,4 300 187 26 2,4 295 183 26,5 2,3 289 180 27 2,3 284 176 27,5 2,3 279 173 28 2,2 274 170 28,5 2,2 269 167 29 2,1 264 164 29,5 2,1 260 161 30 2,1 255 159 The numbers do not match up, can it be something wrong? If your average consumption on our last trip does not match up with the estimated range it might be a problem with your Audi Q4 e-tron.\nThe first you should try is to calculate the battery capacity so you are sure there is a problem. This would also make it easier for you to document this for your dealer.\nRead this guide to calculate and verify your Audi Q4 e-tron battery status\nIf your conclusion is that the battery capacity is much lower of the specified capacity it might be problem with battery or BMS\nLearn more about the range Read our complete range guide Understanding range.

The model is defined not only by impressive driving and charging performance, but also by increased efficiency and long range. The Audi Q6 e-tron embodies typical Audi SUV styling with a further refined e-tron design language. The new design philosophy in the interior and pioneering technologies debuting in the new model, begin the next chapter in electric mobility for the Four Rings and make Vorsprung durch Technik a tangible experience every day. With the Q6 e-tron range, e mobility is coming from the Ingolstadt plant for the first time. The Audi Q6 e-tron quattro and SQ6 e-tron will be available to order from March 2024 at a price of 74.700 and 93.800 euros and will be delivered to customers in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe PPE, developed jointly with Porsche, and the E3 1.2 electronic architecture are important milestones in the expansion of Audi\u0026rsquo;s global range of electrically powered models. They mark the start of a comprehensive strengthening and rejuvenation of the model portfolio. The Q6 e-tron underpins Audi’s promise to offer electric vehicles in all core segments by 2027. “Built on the new PPE platform, the Audi Q6 e-tron is the next technological leap in premium electric mobility for our customers,\u0026quot; said Gernot Döllner, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG, at the world premiere at the main plant in Ingolstadt. \u0026ldquo;The PPE shows how we are pooling expertise within the Volkswagen Group and thus making electric mobility scalable. Thanks to the PPE, we are able to launch high-volume models with high technical standards in different segments and thus further electrify our portfolio,\u0026rdquo; the Audi CEO added.\nAudi CEO, Gernot Döllner The flexibility of the PPE helps in giving the future models their independent character and the typical Audi DNA, despite shared technical underpinnings.\nThe Q6 e-tron sets standards in terms of e‑performance, range, and charging. It embodies typical Audi SUV styling with a further refined e-tron design language and a high level of everyday usability. Thanks to the new E3 1.2 electronic architecture, the Q6 e-tron model series represents the technological spearhead of the Audi portfolio.\nImpressive range and charging performance Powerful, compact, and highly efficient electric motors, as well as a newly developed lithium-ion battery consisting of twelve modules and 180 prismatic cells with a total gross capacity of 100 kWh (94.9 net) ensure a range of up to 625 km (388 mi). The new Audi Q6 e-tron ensures the sporty performance Audi is known for with a system output of 285 kW (power consumption in kWh/100 km combined: 19.4-17.0 (WLTP); CO2 emissions in g/km combined: 0; CO2-class A) and the SQ6 e-tron with a system output of up to 380 kW when the extra function is engaged (power consumption in kWh/100 km combined: 18.4-17.5 (WLTP); CO2 emissions in g/km combined: 0; CO2-class A) thus set standards in terms of performance, range, charging, driving dynamics, and design. At market launch, two model variants with all-wheel drive will be available, followed – depending on the market - by particularly efficient models with rear-wheel drive designed for range, which will also mark the entry into the Q6 e-tron series.\nThe Q6 e-tron quattro accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 5.9 seconds (combined power consumption in kWh/100 km: 19.4-17.0 (WLTP); combined CO2 emissions in g/km: 0; CO2-class A). The SQ 6 e-tron takes just 4.3 seconds (combined power consumption in kWh/100 km: 18.4-17.5 (WLTP); combined CO2 emissions in g/km: 0; CO2-class A). The vehicles’ top speeds are 210 (130 mph) and 230 km/h (142 mph) respectively. Two models with rear‑wheel drive will follow at a later date - depending on the market. While one model will be designed for efficiency and range, the other will mark the entry into the Q6 e-tron series.\nThanks to 800‑volt technology and a maximum charging capacity of 270 kW as standard, short charging stops are possible with the Audi Q6 e-tron. Up to 255 km (158 mi) can be recharged in just ten minutes at an appropriate charging station (High Power Charging, HPC). The state-of-charge (SoC) increases from ten to 80 percent in around 21 minutes. Intelligent, high-performance and predictive thermal management is a key component of this impressive charging performance. Equipped with Plug \u0026amp; Charge, the vehicle authorizes itself at compatible charging stations when the charging cable is plugged in and commences the charging process. Charging is also fully automatic. If a charging station works with 400‑volt technology, the Audi Q6 e-tron can, for the first time, enable bank charging. The 800‑volt battery is automatically divided into two batteries at equal voltage, which can then be charged in parallel with up to 135 kW. Depending on the state of charge, both halves of the battery are first equalized and then charged simultaneously. AC charging with up to 11 kW is possible at standard home chargers.\nAn important component in increasing the efficiency and therefore the range of the Audi Q6 e-tron is the advanced recuperation system. Around 95 percent of all everyday braking processes can be handled by this system. The Audi Q6 e-tron recuperates at up to 220 kW.\nTypical Audi SUV design: the exterior The Audi Q6 e-tron is positioned in the premium midsize segment and, with a length of 4,771 millimeters (15.6 ft), a width of 1,993 millimeters (6.5 ft) and a height of 1,648 millimeters (5.4 ft), the SUV offers maximum space, comfort and suitability for everyday use. The wheelbase of 2,899 millimeters (9.5 ft) allows plenty of legroom in the second row of seats. With these dimensions, the Audi Q6 e-tron offers sufficient space for five passengers and luggage and offers high utility value. Audi thus fulfills the requirements customers place on an SUV.\nPlasma blå Audi Q6 e-tron The Audi Q6 e-tron comes with perfect proportions thanks to the Premium Platform Electric. The ratio of a long wheelbase to very short overhangs forms the basis for the familiar powerful, dynamic package seen in the exterior of Audi\u0026rsquo;s Q models. The Audi Q6 e-tron also embodies the further developed e-tron-specific design language.\nIts striking SUV look makes for an impressive and sporty appearance. In the car’s bodywork, soft shapes are in constant interplay with the creases and edges, lending dynamism to the shadows even when stationary. The upright front features a completely closed Singleframe and a mask in selenite silver or gloss black, which surrounds the three-dimensionally shaped Singleframe and the side air intakes. The high-positioned digital daytime running lights give the Q6 e-tron a very distinctive and independent appearance.\nThe greenhouse is stretched low and taut over the powerful body. It is slightly tapered towards the rear and the gently sloping D‑pillars flow elegantly into the bodywork’s muscular shoulders. The opening between the D‑pillar and the roof gives the vehicle a more dynamic appearance and makes the cabin appear more stretched and longer. A prominent line running from the rear lights to the rear doors emphasizes the upper section of the “quattro blisters” - the contours of the body on which the gently sloping D‑pillars are supported. The blisters are a core element of Audi\u0026rsquo;s design DNA. Audi calls this central design principle \u0026ldquo;making technology visible\u0026rdquo;. The dynamically tightened rear creates a mixture of sporty elegance and masculine power. The clean and broad rear architecture with its continuous light strip lends the Q6 e-tron quattro the clarity and aplomb typical of Audi.\nWorld first in lighting technology With the Q6 e-tron, Audi is not only starting a new chapter in electric mobility, but also in an important part of Audi\u0026rsquo;s DNA: lighting technology. With the world\u0026rsquo;s first active digital light signature, the electric SUV is ushering in a new era characterized by design and aesthetics that are unique to Audi.\nA software module in one of the five domain computers of the Audi Q6 e-tron makes this form of light signature possible. In the case of the second-generation digital OLED rear lights, the six OLED panels with a total of 360 segments generate a new image every ten milliseconds using a specially developed algorithm. Thanks to the perfect symbiosis between the lighting design and the new technology, the light in the new Audi Q6 e-tron appears livelier and more intelligent than ever before. The active digital light signature also points the way to the future of Audi lighting technology.\nAt the front, the active digital light signature is created by the interaction of the algorithm with twelve segments that dim up and down. At the rear, all digital OLED segments are used for this purpose. The individual light segments interact in such a way that the total light intensity of the light signature does not vary.\nWith the second generation of digital OLED rear lights, the Audi Q6 e-tron takes lighting design, functionality and therefore road safety to a new level. For the first time, the digital OLED rear lights can communicate with the vehicle’s surroundings in a targeted manner (Car‑to‑X). Audi has also taken the safety functions to a new level. The proximity detection system already known from other Audi models has been extended in the new Q6 e-tron to include the communication light. It warns other road users of accident and breakdown sites. In addition to the regular taillight graphics, the communication light displays a specific static tail light signature with integrated warning symbols in the digital OLED combination rear light in critical driving or traffic situations.\nThe technology, which is debuting in the Audi Q6 e-tron, also sets new standards in terms of individualization: With a total of up to eight digital light signatures in the redesigned daytime running lights of the Matrix LED headlights and in the digital OLED rear lights 2.0, owners can individualize their Q6 e-tron in a completely new way.\nA new design philosophy goes into series production with the Q6 e-tron The interior of the Audi Q6 e-tron is orientated towards the needs of the user more than ever. The three-dimensional and high-contrast design of the interior deliberately places elements in the foreground or background, creating a spatial architecture that is tailored to the occupants in terms of design and ergonomics. The Audi MMI panoramic display and the MMI passenger display form a visually clear digital stage. The interior emphasizes a homely ambience. The “Softwrap” extends from the doors across the entire cockpit to the center console, creating a homogeneous and enveloping feeling of space. The same colors and high-quality materials, some of which are recycled, can also be found in the seats. The materials used were selected from a functional point of view and at the same time ensure a clear design differentiation between the various vehicle areas in the interior. Comfort-oriented areas are designed with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control areas in high-quality high-gloss black emphasize the clarity of interaction with the vehicle.\nAudi Q6 interior Thanks to the new PPE, which was developed specifically for e-mobility, the vehicle has a generous feeling of space and roominess as well as a high level of everyday practicality. The interior offers plenty of storage space and compartments. The increased comfort of the middle seat in the rear is typical of an electric car with a long wheelbase (2,899 millimeters, equivalent to 9.5 ft) and lacking a central tunnel. The trunk offers 526 liters (18.5 cu ft) of storage space. If the rear seat bench is folded down, the storage space increases to up to 1,529 liters (53.9 cu ft). The rear seats can be folded down separately (40:20:40). A further 64 liters (2.2 cu ft) of storage are available in the frunk (front trunk) under the front hood - a convenient place to stow smaller travel bags, for example. As a result, the Audi Q6 e-tron offers sufficient space for five passengers and their luggage. With its high utility value, it fulfils the requirements that customers place on an Audi SUV.\nE3 1.2 - high-performance and future-oriented electronic architecture With the newly developed electronic architecture E3 1.2, customers experience digitalization in the vehicle more directly than ever before. The name E3 stands for End-to-End Electronic Architecture. During development, the overriding goal was to create a future-proof, standardized framework. The function-oriented architecture is based on a new domain computer structure with five high-performance computers (High-Performance Computing Platform, HCP), which control all vehicle functions - from infotainment and driving functions through to semi-automated driving in later evolutionary stages. The most powerful electronic architecture to date in terms of computing power is consistently geared towards customer requirements. One focus of development was on high-performance and secure networking of domain computers, control units, sensors, and actuators in order to master more complex systems and maintain modularity. In addition, the E3 1.2 is characterized by a high-performance and seamless backend connection for Car-to-X swarm data applications and computationally intensive offboard functions. It is debuting in the Audi Q6 e-tron, designed to be used across models, and forms the basis for future innovations.\nDigital Stage: new display and operating concept The Audi Q6 e-tron model series has a fully connected and digital interior based on the new electronic architecture. Made up by the Audi MMI panoramic display and the MMI passenger display, the so-called Digital Stage is a key feature of the interior. The clearly grouped displays are perfectly integrated into the design concept and give the interior a generous and airy feeling of space.\nAudi Q6 e-tron with virtual cockpit, MMI screen and MMI front passenger screen The slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display has a curved design and OLED technology and consists of the 11.9-inch Audi virtual cockpit and the 14.5-inch MMI touch display. The driver\u0026rsquo;s area is designed as a curve and the display with its concave shape is oriented towards the driver. The contours of the curved display are also reminiscent of the single frame typical of Audi. The ambient lighting makes the Curved Display seem to float at night and creates a suitable setting. Especially for the front passengers, Audi complements the digital stage with the 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display with Active Privacy Mode, which prevents it from distracting the driver while on the move. This allows the front passenger to stream films/video content, assist with navigation, or even find a charging station for example.\nWith the optional Augmented Reality Head-Up Display, another central element of the digital stage, Audi is taking a major step forward in display technology. It reflects a large tilted image plane across the windshield towards the driver and shows relevant information such as speed, traffic signs, assistance, and navigation symbols. The image plane is tilted forwards to enhance the augmented reality impression. The focus of the human eye moves with it. This process and the far virtual distance of the image create the impression that the elements shown are floating up to 200 meters (656 ft) away. Virtual content is thus seamlessly integrated into reality.\nThe information can be understood quickly without irritating or distracting the person driving. The field of view of the augmented reality function corresponds to a diagonal of around 88 inches viewed from the driver\u0026rsquo;s position.\nAudi\u0026rsquo;s self-learning voice assistant, the Audi Assistant, can be used to control numerous vehicle functions. The digital assistant with AI support is deeply integrated into the vehicle and, for the first time, is displayed using an avatar in the central touch display of the MMI and in the augmented reality head-up display. The new voice assistant understands more than 800 voice commands. It can also be activated via various touchpoints and via the myAudi app, for example. The voice assistant learns continuously based on user behavior and thus provides support to the person driving. This support can be grouped into three categories: proactive suggestions (context information is used to proactively suggest functions for activation based on this data), smart routines (automatically recognizes recurring operating sequences, such as using the seat climate control from certain outside temperatures) and intelligent lists (such as call lists). The spoken commands are also shown on the display (see-what-you-speak principle). The assistant constantly learns from user behavior and thus supports the driver.\nInfotainment – integrates customers’ digital world The new infotainment system uses Android Automotive OS as its operating system for the first time. Content is always up to date thanks to over-the-air updates. The latest Audi connect services and the enhanced e-tron route planner, included as standard, are therefore always up to date. Apps such as YouTube are available via the store for third-party apps, which is integrated directly into the MMI and does not require a smartphone.\nThe store gives customers access to a wide range of apps. Applications from categories including the following are available at launch: Music, video, gaming, navigation, parking \u0026amp; charging, productivity, weather, and news services. The store is constantly being expanded and the app portfolio is market-specific.\nThe heart of the Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen Premium sound system is a highly efficient amplifier. It drives 20 loudspeakers with 830 watts of power. Four of these are integrated into the headrests of the front seats, for the first time enabling sound zones in an Audi. The dynamic interaction light (IAL) offers a variety of communication functions and thus supports the car\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the occupants. It spans the interior and cockpit as a broad arc. The standard equipment of the Q6 e-tron series also includes the enhanced e-tron route planner.\nPrecisely tuned driving dynamics thanks to new steering and torque distribution Most of the systems and components making up to the chassis are newly developed. Typical for Audi are the superior and easily controllable acceleration and deceleration in all driving situations. There is a precisely defined set-up philosophy with regard to the chassis. The suspension control systems involved are precisely coordinated with each other. The driving dynamics of the Q6 e-tron are significantly influenced by the partially redesigned front axle.\nFor the first time in an Audi model, the control arms are positioned in front of the suspension arms. This results above all in package advantages for the positioning of the high-voltage battery. The newly developed components lead to improved kinematic properties.\nThe steering rack is now fixed to a subframe. The refined axle kinematics provide noticeably increased driving dynamics. The new front axle also improves the steering behavior. This makes the vehicle feel significantly more agile.\nThe rear-biased torque distribution as part of a highly variable all-wheel drive system also enhances the dynamic driving characteristics of the Q6 e-tron. The different dimensions of the electric motors on the rear and front axles enable rear-biased torque distribution even under full load. In order to complement the rear-biased weight distribution as well as to ensure even more grip and driving dynamics, the rear tires of the Q6 e-tron are wider than those at the front.\nAlways ready to assist - the driver assistance systems Relating to the driver assistance systems of the new Q6 e-tron, Audi provides a wide range of functions that significantly improve everyday driving and road safety for all road users. A new feature for the Q6 e-tron is the adaptive driving assistant plus. It not only helps with acceleration, maintaining speed, keeping distance and lane guidance, but also uses high-resolution map data and swarm data from other vehicles aggregated in the cloud to improve the handling of the Q6 e-tron. The SUV uses the radar sensors, the front camera, and ultrasonic sensors for easy to operate guidance. The vehicle uses the collected information to create a virtual route and follows it dependably and as comfortably as possible across the entire speed range and in traffic jams.\nRear parking assistance, cruise control, lane departure warning, efficiency assist, active front assist and a distraction and drowsiness warning system are all on board as standard from launch. Customers have the option of further assistance systems and a safety package as part of various equipment packages.\nMaterials from recycling processes Materials prepared using recycling processes reduce the use of primary resources in the production of the Q6 e-tron and ensure a closed and therefore efficient and sustainable material cycle. In addition to materials made from recycled polyester, the plastic components typical of electric models such as the frunk and the adjacent covers in the front section of the Q6 e-tron are also made from recycled material. This also applies to the covers below the windshield and over the HVAC intake.\nTo produce the steel required for the outer roof section of all Q6 e-tron models, Audi uses scrap steel, some of which comes from end-of-life vehicles previously in use by customers. The proportion of scrap used in steel production averages up to 15 percent (mass balance approach based on currently planned production figures). This component is a good example of how Audi intends to use more post-consumer secondary materials in its products in the future.\nSustainable and flexible: production of the Audi Q6 e-tron The Q6 e-tron model family, the first all-electric model series produced at the Ingolstadt plant, stands for Audi\u0026rsquo;s commitment to sustainability, from production to product. The company is gradually refitting all production sites for the manufacture of all-electric models instead of building new ones. In line with the early decision to phase out the combustion engine, Audi has also intensively promoted the transformation of its employees and trained the workforce for fields of the future, for example in the new battery assembly plant in Ingolstadt. The brand with the four rings is thus increasing vertical integration and bringing important skills to the sites. At the same time, Audi is creating new job opportunities.\nIn order to produce the Q6 e-tron series sustainably and efficiently, Audi uses existing structures and systems. The brand seamlessly integrates the model series into existing assembly lines, such as the body shop for the PPE. The bodies for the PPE models are produced at the Ingolstadt plant in a building covering around 148,000 square meters (almost 1,600,000 sq ft). The bodywork components for the Q6 e-tron series are made by 328 employees per shift and 1,150 robots with a degree of automation of 87 percent.\nVideos Below you will find some videoes of the new models. In addition, you will find more in the multimedia section for the Audi Q6 e-tron.\nAudi Q6 e tron – Design – Animation Audi Q6 e tron – New display operating concept – Animation Audi Q6 e-tron final REVEAL of the Porsche Macan EV brother "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/activesphere/","title":"Audi activesphere concept","tags":[],"description":"As the fourth model in the series, the Audi activesphere concept marks the culmination of sphere concept vehicles brought forth by the brand with the four rings.","content":" Audi activesphere concept Following on from the Audi skysphere roadster in 2021, and both the Audi grandsphere sedan, and the Audi urbansphere space concept in April 2022, a four-door crossover coupé with an astonishingly versatile body design is now making its debut. Standing 4.98 meters long, the highly elegant car is more than a mere luxury-class sports car, with impressive ground clearance, and large 22-inch wheels announcing its off-road talent. The Sportback rear of the activesphere can turn into an open cargo bed (“active back”) at the touch of a button – perfect for carrying recreational equipment such as e-bikes or water and winter sports gear.\nBy combining opposites in perfect synthesis, the Audi activesphere proves to be a versatile crosser of boundaries, with a drive system and suspension which make it equally adept on both on and off the road. The steering wheel and pedals allow the driver to actively control the car, while also offering autonomous driving for a more relaxed time on the road. As a coupé that is as elegant as it is dynamic, it features classic proportions and lines, but in just a few seconds, the car transforms into a pickup for transporting top-class sports gear – there is even enough space for two e-bikes in the cargo bed.\nThe concept car was conceived and designed at the Audi Design Studio in Malibu, just a stone’s throw away from the Pacific Coast Highway, the legendary coastal road. Studio manager Gael Buzyn and his team are the creative minds behind the project. He describes the idea behind the project: “The activesphere is unique. It is a new type of crossover that cleverly combines the elegance of an Audi Sportback, the practicality of a SUV and true offroad capabilities.”\nWith an electric drive and quick-charging technology from Audi’s PPE modular system, the Audi activesphere joins the sphere family of concept vehicles. With no local emissions, a range of over 600 km, and extremely fast charging times thanks to 800-volt technology, it combines the sustainability, dynamics and long-distance capability of state-of-the-art electric vehicles.\nOliver Hoffmann, Member of the Board of Management for Technical Development: “The sphere concept vehicles show our vision for the premium mobility of the future. We are experiencing a paradigm shift, especially in the interior of our future Audi models. The interior becomes a place where the passengers feel at home and can connect to the world outside at the same time. The most important technical innovation in the Audi activesphere is our adaptation of augmented reality for mobility. Audi dimensions creates the perfect synthesis between the surroundings and digital reality.”\nThe autonomous chauffeuring capability on suitable terrain gives drivers and passengers a new level of freedom, which, thanks to the new display and operating technology, can be used in the activesphere in a variety of ways. The innovative operating concept, Audi dimensions, combines the physical and virtual worlds (i.e., mixed reality) by displaying digital content in the occupants’ fields of vision in real time.\nHigh-tech headsets provide a view of the real environment and the route, while simultaneously displaying 3D content and interactive elements– individually configurable for drivers and passengers.\nThis means all driver-relevant information, such as driving status and navigation, can be displayed. And in the interior, headset users can see control panels and other virtual displays in a tidy, minimalist design that remains hidden to the unaided eye. Mixed reality optics gives users the ability to interact precisely with these real, yet invisible, touch-sensitive zones, as the headsets display and carry out functions by reacting in real time when users touch them.\nAs a perfect all-rounder, the Audi activesphere concept is ideally suited for the high demands of a future-oriented generation of Audi customers – people for whom individual mobility and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. Also, owners who expect their vehicle to deliver the brand’s typical aesthetics and dynamism in the highest degree, combined with future-oriented technology. For these customers, the Audi activesphere concept acts as a fascinating vision of crossing the boundaries between these dimensions.\nAudi activesphere concept Robust elegance – exterior design Its dimensions – 4.98 meters long, 2.07 meters wide, and 1.60 meters high – make the Audi activesphere concept a member of the premium segment. Typical of an electric car, the wheelbase is a generous 2.97 meters, providing maximum legroom for passengers. The front and rear overhangs are correspondingly short for a much more compact impression than the mere numbers indicate. From all perspectives, the Audi activesphere concept appears monolithic, as if from a single mold.\nLarge 22-inch wheels and striking ground clearance, the flat cabin so typical of an Audi, and a dynamic roof arch give the car proportions that are distinctly reminiscent of a sports car.\nThe 285/55 tires are voluminous enough for all types of terrain, and their contoured tread highlights the activesphere’s talent for off-road use. The wheels feature movable segments: when used off-road, they open for optimum ventilation, and they close on-road for optimum aerodynamics. The elegant, stylish camera mirrors on the two front doors are also designed specifically to minimize drag.\nThe absence of hard edges results in smooth transitions between convex and concave surfaces throughout the body, as well as in soft shadows. Viewed from the side and rear, the rear wheel wells appear markedly horizontal, visualizing the dynamic potential of the concept vehicle.\nGlass surfaces make up a significant part of the vehicle’s body – and by no means just at head height. The front end of the activesphere features the brand face, the Singleframe, designed as a transparent glazing to afford passengers an unobstructed view through the large frunk of the road in front of the vehicle.\nThere are also glass surfaces on the side in the lower door area, which seem to dissolve the boundary between the natural world and the interior when the activesphere is in off-road mode. The wide, curved tailgate features extensive glazing for optimum lighting, whilst even the roof itself is transparent, letting plenty of daylight into the interior.\nAudi activesphere concept glass surface The exterior look specifically signals the vehicle’s off-road capability and, with its voluminous wheel arches, portrays the variable, electronically controlled quattro all-wheel drive. The Audi activesphere’s ground clearance is also variable; ideal for off-road use, it can be increased by 40 millimeters from the basic height of 208 millimeters, or lowered by the same amount when driving on-road. This benefits both the center of gravity and aerodynamics when driving fast. The approach angle of the Audi activesphere – relevant for off-road drives – is 18.9 degrees, the departure angle 28.1 degrees.\nThe variable ground clearance is reminiscent of an Audi model family that has attracted an enthusiastic, loyal fan base in the C and later B segments since 2000 – the Audi allroad. From the first generation, this family also features air-spring suspension with variable ground clearance and a visually offset floor assembly with underride guard elements as a significant design feature. Equally significant for all allroad models is the Avant package option.\nThe activesphere marks the first time that a car with a Sportback hatchback incorporates the design elements and technical equipment of an allroad. For this reason, Audi calls the new body variant “active Sportback” in contrast to the allroad.\nAnother new variation of the allroad theme – the Audi activesphere concept features dark, high-gloss paint finishes in Arctic Teal on the front and rear as well as underneath the doors in the side area, plus matte surfaces that visually juxtapose the floor assembly and cabin. Metal strips with slightly offset vertical studs, arranged parallel to one another, are integrated here. These elements deploy when the ground clearance is increased, visualizing the off-road mode.\nAs with its relative, the Audi grandsphere concept, the doors of the Audi activesphere, which are attached to the A- and C-pillars at the front and rear, open in opposite directions; there is no B-pillar here either. This innovation means the entire interior space opens up to passengers as soon as they get into the car.\nRight and left above the Singleframe, the narrow headlight units appear like focused eyes. The lighting units echo the logo of the brand with the four rings by enlarging and isolating the intersection of two rings to form a pupil – a new, unmistakable digital light signature that Audi first introduced in the Audi grandsphere: the Audi eye. In the activesphere, this signature is now varied – on-road and off-road driving modes each have their own variant. Daytime running lights and rear lights use ultra-fine micro-LED technology for even greater precision and contrast.\nAudi activesphere concept Sportback and active back – variable rear architecture The Audi activesphere concept is a crosser of boundaries, which means it is a master of metamorphosis. Its rear section in particular reflects the active lifestyle of its customers and makes it possible to transport even bulky sports gear– without sacrificing the elegance and sportiness of the Sportback silhouette.\nIf required, the transparent rear window slides are almost flush with the roof of the Audi activesphere. At the same time, the lower, vertical segment of the rear folds horizontally – this opens up an ample cargo bed called the active back that features brackets for e-bikes, for example. The lateral surfaces of the rear, the C-pillars, remain in position to maintain the activesphere’s dynamic silhouette, whilst a motorized bulkhead deploys from behind the rear seats in order to isolate the cabine from the elements.\nAudi activesphere concept with bikes A ski rack is integrated in the center of the roof structure. Completely flush in nominal position and practically invisibly in the roof arch, it extends if required, so that skis can be safely attached and transported.\nPrioritized interior – people-focused “Sphere” sets the tone: the common name component of the Audi skysphere, grandsphere, urbansphere, and now also the activesphere, alludes to the interior. Kilowatts and km/h or lateral acceleration are no longer at the top of the design specifications for this new generation of cars. Instead, the starting point is the interior, the occupants’ living and experience sphere whilst traveling. Their needs and desires shape the space, the architecture, and the functions.\nWith that reassessment, the design process itself changes. At the beginning of all discussions, the focus is directed toward the interior and its design. Only then are the package, proportions, and lines of the exterior designed.\nAudi activesphere concept Functional and minimalist – the interior The epitome of clarity and tidiness – this is the first impression for passengers as they climb into the interior of the Audi activesphere through the wide-open doors.\nVertical and horizontal surfaces, along with right angles dominate the architecture of the space. The interior zones feature horizontal contrasting coloring and the reigning centerpiece is the seating surfaces and door and front paneling in warm lava red, which contrast with the dark exterior even when looking through the side windows. Above and below this central zone, dark colors (black, anthracite, and dark gray) also dominate.\nThe four individual seats are suspended like extensions of the high, full-length center console. Resting on the center console, the upper end of the seat shell’s inner side is shaped horizontally as an armrest. The designers imagined the seat, back, and shoulder surfaces as three separate, circumferential shells; the visual appearance alone already promises good lateral support. They also appear so light as to float and thus maintain the balance between automotive function and the elegance of a lounge chair.\nWhen the Audi activesphere concept is driving in autonomous mode, the dashboard, steering wheel, and pedals disappear into an invisible position. Especially in the first row of seats, a wide space opens in front of the driver, which extends to the front end of the activesphere – and beyond. For a clear field of vision, the fully glazed Singleframe gives passengers an unobstructed view of the road in front.\nAudi activesphere concept autonomous mode The dashboard itself works like a xlarge soundbar (through the wood lammels) as well as a smart, full width airvent in both the deployed and stowed position.\nIf the driver wants to take over the wheel, the dashboard, along with the steering wheel, swivels out from its flush position below the windshield – each driver can adjust the ideal ergonomic position individually. The MMI touchless controls in the doors are always accessible to the eye and the hand,for example to control windows and seat adjustments.\nThe architecture and sense of space in the Audi activesphere are largely determined by the high, full-length center console. Of course, in electric cars the console is no longer needed to hold a cardan shaft, but instead offers space for storage and an on-board bar – either cooled or heated. The top cover is transparent, which provides a view of the bottle and glasses, but also visually integrates the voluminous console in the interior. Additionally, there is a console in the roof, directly above the center console and reflecting its dimensions, where the four AR headsets for the mixed reality system are kept within easy reach for all passengers.\nAudi dimensions – traversing worlds Crossing boundaries is the strength of the Audi activesphere concept – and this also applies to the interface between the car, the user, and the environment. For the first time, the new system combines physical reality and the digital sphere to create a new world: the Audi dimensions.\nThe centerpiece of the new system is innovative mixed reality headsets – available individually for each driver and passenger. Users also have access to a comprehensive digital ecosystem while they’re in the Audi activesphere.\nIn the early days, VR goggles were limited to depicting a virtual reality without any real-world elements. However, technology evolved into augmented reality, whereby the real world is superimposed with virtual content. Mixed reality is now able to depict virtual content with spatial reference to the real world in three dimensions. There’s no doubt about it: in the future, mixed reality will take the possibilities of AR head-up displays to a whole new level in terms of flexibility, precision, and displayable content.\nAudi activesphere concept The Audi activesphere concept is the first to use a pioneering generation of this technology, which in turn adds the dimension of interaction to the dimension of superimposed real and digital worlds. With unprecedented optical precision, highest resolution, and excellent contrast, the system brings control surfaces and displays, invisible to the unaided eye, into the user’s field of vision while behind the steering wheel.\nIn other words, the user can view virtual content, which is initially for information only. If the user focuses with his or her eyes on the information, thus signaling interest, the system displays more detailed information. Content becomes an active and interactive element as soon as the user is focused and engages, i.e., with gestures.\nThe hand can then intuitively follow the user’s gaze to control car functions, while the user interface (the virtual display in the headset) reacts to changes in real time like a conventional instrument. A particularly user-friendly feature, the virtual control moves towards the user so that he or she can interact comfortably with the user interface, regardless of sitting position.\nThe tidy, spacious interior of the Audi activesphere no longer has to take a back seat to the function of keyboards and scale batteries, as was always the case in classic car cockpits. Only when users need an element does it appear, and it can be operated just as intuitively as it would in the real world. Important: The diverse functions of the car are now not organized in the typical way they are today in a car with screens and physical function. But they are instead located logically directly in front of the elements they are related to. Just two examples: the AC control hoovers in front of the airvent, the entertainment and sound interactive panel hoovers over the speaker.\nHowever, the possibilities of this technology are by no means exhausted. In off-road mode, for example, high-resolution 3D topography graphics can be projected onto the real landscape and information on navigation and the destination can be displayed. Traffic safety information, i.e., alerts for traffic jams or slippery roads, can also be used here.\nDepending on their needs and tasks, passengers and drivers are provided with very individual content in their respective mixed reality headset. With the driver concentrating on steering while active behind the wheel, passengers can begin looking into and even preparing activities at the destination.\nYet, at the same time they can also control the temperature and air supply for their seating area with the air conditioning, as well as browse the music selection of the sound system, which each occupant can use individually. Because the headsets are precisely designed to match the geometry of the activesphere interior, they can even project virtual index cards onto the center console to visualize access to web content. Since the sensors of the mixed reality headsets measure the interior with millimeter precision, virtual content can be superimposed according to personal requirements and even used for individual interaction.\nThe connection between the headset users and the car, along with its ecosystem, offers countless possibilities, even when outside the car. For example, while navigation routes or vehicle maintenance can be prepared today from your living room on a laptop or tablet, in the future mixed reality technology and the headset will be the only hardware required.\nConversely, the activesphere passenger can take his or her headset out of the car and onto the ski slope to help navigate the bike trail or to find the ideal descent when skiing downhill.\nInformation about the car itself, the battery range, and the nearest charging stations can also be accessed inside and outside the vehicle. And when needed, there are also advance warnings such as of low tire pressure as well as a weather forecast function as a criterion for selecting a route.\nPPE – customized drive technology Due to its dimensions and performance level, the Audi activesphere concept lends itself to the use of Audi’s most innovative electric drive system: the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE for short.\nLike the related Audi grandsphere and Audi urbansphere concept cars, the activesphere concept draws on this modular system for series production. It is being developed under Audi’s leadership together with Porsche AG – the first Audi production vehicles based on PPE will be presented, one after the other, before the end of 2023.\nRead more about the upcomming PPE models in our Audi Q6 e-tron section and our Audi A6 e-tron section.\nThe PPE is designed exclusively for battery-electric drive systems and can therefore take full advantage of all the benefits of this technology – for the betterment of the cars’ driving characteristics, economy, and package options.\nAs a result, Audi can effectively expand the range of electric vehicles in its portfolio via the high-volume B- and C-segments. In addition, economies of scale will allow luxury-class technology and various different model versions to be incorporated into a wide-ranging lineup of models unrivaled in the premium market.\nThe PPE is the first platform designed to accommodate an unprecedented range of high-volume automobiles – including SUVs and CUVs with high ground clearance as well as cars with a flat silhouette that are part of Audi’s core product range, such as the Audi A6 series, whose external dimensions and wheelbase are almost identical to the Audi activesphere concept.\nThe key element of the future PPE fleet is a battery module between the axles; in the Audi activesphere concept, it holds around 100 kWh of energy. Using the entire car width between the axles makes it possible to achieve a relatively flat layout for the battery.\nElectric motors on the front and rear axles of the all-wheel drive Audi activesphere concept together deliver a total output of 325 kW and a system torque of 720 Newton meters. The front and rear wheels are connected via a five-link axle. The concept car features Audi adaptive air suspension with adaptive dampers.\nFast charging with 800 volts The heart of the drive technology in all future PPE models will be the 800-volt charging technology. This ensures that the battery, like the one in the Audi e-tron GT quattro before it, can be charged with up to 270 kW in a very short time at fast-charging stations. This revolutionary technology will enter the high-volume mid-range and luxury segments with the PPE for the very first time.\nThe PPE technology enables charging times that come close to a conventional refueling stop for a combustion engine car. Just 10 minutes is sufficient time to take enough energy on board to power the car for more than 300 kilometers.\nAnd in less than 25 minutes, the 100 kWh battery charges from 5 to 80 percent. Together with its range of well over 600 kilometers, the Audi activesphere thus positions itself as unconditionally suitable for long distances, when need be.\nVideos "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audiq6worldpremiere/","title":"Audi Q6 e-tron world premiere","tags":[],"description":"The Audi Q8 e-tron is the facelift of the very popular Audi e-tron.

You also find many links in the model\u0026rsquo;s description for more information about options and technology for the Audi Q8 e-tron.\nAudi SQ8 e-tron With the Audi e-tron, the premium manufacturer entered the age of electromobility in 2018, marking the start of the electric future for the four rings.\nSince then, the model has been setting standards in the electric luxury-class SUV segment. The new Audi Q8 e-tron is now building on the success story of this electric pioneer. The top-of-the-line electric SUV and crossover impress with their optimized drive concept, improved aerodynamics, higher charging performance, and battery capacity, and increased WLTP range of up to 582 kilometers in the SUV version and up to 600 kilometers in the Sportback version. In addition, significant changes, especially at the front of the vehicle, lend the new flagship SUV a fresher appearance.\nSince introducing the Audi e-tron around four years ago and selling 150,000 units, Audi has followed a systematic electric roadmap. As a result, its electric portfolio now comprises eight models.\nBy 2026, it will have more than 20. At that point, Audi will only be releasing fully electric models on the global market. “With our corporate strategy ‘Vorsprung 2030’, we’ve set a fixed date for our withdrawal from combustion engines and decided that Audi will be a fully electric brand within 11 years,” said Markus Duesmann, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG. “The new Audi Q8 e-tron, with its improved efficiency and range and refined design, is another important component in our electric portfolio to get people excited about electromobility with emotional models suitable for everyday use.”\nAudi Board Member for Technical Development Oliver Hoffmann also focused on the customer benefits enhanced by these refinements. “In the new Q8 e-tron, we significantly increased battery capacity and charging performance. These changes allowed us to achieve an optimal balance between energy density and charging capacity and increase efficiency,” Hoffmann said. “On top of that, we improved the motors, progressive steering, and chassis control systems – and thus the dynamic driving characteristics typical of Audi in all versions of the Q8 e-tron.”\nNew face, new name, new corporate identity By calling this model the Q8, Audi clearly states that the Audi Q8 e-tron is the top model among its electric SUVs and crossovers, sitting above the Audi Q4 e-tron and the upcoming Audi Q6 e-tron.\nAudi SQ8 e-tron front The Audi Q8 e-tron and Q8 Sportback e-tron are immediately identifiable as fully electric models at first glance, thanks to the new front and rear designs that systematically carry Audi’s electric design language forward.\nAs for the Audi e-tron, you can order the Audi Q8 e-tron with black optics or standard optics. But the difference is that a black single-frame grill is not part of the black optics package. (Just like the optics on Audi e-tron GT). Therefore, you can order the single-frame grill in grey, body color, or black. In addition, you can specify the Audi Q8 e-tron with a horizontal light strip on top of the single-frame grille.\nAudi SQ8 e-tron with new lights in single frame grille As a prestigious electric SUV model from Audi, the Q8 e-tron ushers in the new corporate identity with a two-dimensional design of the four rings on the exterior. In addition, the model lettering with an Audi logo on the B-pillar is also new.\nModel lettering with an Audi logo on the B-pilla For all Q8 variants, you can order the model with or without the S-line exterior package. This package contains a sportier front and diffuser.\nNew wheels are available in all sizes for all variants, and many of the Audi e-tron wheels are also available on the Audi Q8 e-tron. See Audi Q8 wheels for a complete overview.\nAudi SQ8 e-tron As on the Audi e-tron, an extensive palette of standard colors is available. In addition, you can choose from around 50 Audi-exclusive colors.\nThere are some new colors available in the standard palette.\nSee paint colors for an overview and more pictures.\nThe option for painted calibers is now in red. This color was orange on the Audi e-tron.\nSpace and comfort With a vehicle length of 4.915 meters, a width of 1.937 meters, and a height of 1.619 meters for the Sportback and 1.633 meters for the SUV, the Q8 e-tron offers ample space and high comfort.\nThe SQ8 e-tron and SQ8 Sportback e-tron are each two millimeters lower and 39 millimeters wider. Its wheelbase of 2.928 meters allows for a lot of legroom in the back seats too.\nIn addition, it has a generous storage volume of 569 liters for the SUV and 528 liters for the Sportback. There are also 62 liters available in the front storage area, the so-called “frunk.”\nThree drivetrain variants For both body shapes, three drivetrain variants are available.\nThe below tables compare the current Audi e-tron variants with the different Q8 e-tron variants for range and consumption for a range-optimized equipment trim. Adding additional equipment like larger wheels will increase consumption and reduce the driving range.\nVariant WLTP range Change Audi e-tron 50 341km/212mi Audi Q8 50 e-tron 491km/305mi +44% Audi e-tron 50 Sportback 351km/218mi Audi Q8 50 Sportback e-tron 505km/314mi +44% Audi e-tron 55 441km/274mi Audi Q8 55 e-tron 582km/362mi +32% Audi e-tron 55 Sportback 452km/281mi Audi Q8 55 Sportback e-tron 600km/373mi +33% Audi e-tron S 374km/232mi Audi SQ8 e-tron 494km/307mi +32% Audi e-tron S Sportback 379km/235mi Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback 513km/319mi +35% This diagram shows the same including other all-electric SUV models from Audi.

The battery of the Q8 50 e-tron has a storage capacity of 89 net kilowatt-hours (95 gross kWh), while the more powerful versions of the Q8 55 e-tron and SQ8 e-tron have 106 net kWh (114 gross kWh). The 95kWh battery used on the 50 variants uses the same battery used on the Audi 55 and S variants. Thanks to adjusting the battery management system, the battery capacity usable for customers has increased from 86kWh to 89kWh.\nAt a high-powered charging station, the Audi Q8 50 e-tron reaches a maximum charging performance of 150 kW. With the Q8 55 e-tron and SQ8 e-tron, the maximum charging performance increases to 170 kW. The big battery can be charged from ten to 80 percent during a roughly 31-minute charging stop – under ideal conditions, this corresponds to a range of up to 420 kilometers (according to WLTP).\nAudi e-tron has been market-leading in average charging speed since its introduction. So how does this compare to the facelift? Together with EVKX.net, electrichasgoneaudi.net gives you the details. Below is the charging curve for Audi Q8 50 e-tron (same as the Audi e-tron 55) and the Audi Q8 e-tron 55 with the new battery.\nHow does this affect the traveling speed? To answer this, we calculate how long the old and new models need to travel 1000km, starting with a full battery, driving at 120km/h, and only stopping for optimal charging stops. The calculation assumes optimal driving conditions with dry roads and temperatures around 20 degrees Celcius.\nVariant Consumption 120km/h Chargestops Total time Saved Audi e-tron 50 26.5kWh/100km 5 x (5%-68%) 10h:32m Audi Q8 50 e-tron 26 kWh/100km 3 x (15%-80%) 9h:49m -43m Audi e-tron 50 Sportback 25 kWh/100km 4 x (3%-76%) 10h:22m Audi Q8 50 Sportback e-tron 24.5 kWh/100km 2 x (5%-80%) 9h:33m -49m Audi e-tron 55 27.5 kWh/100km 3 x (6%-80%) 9h:57m Audi Q8 55 e-tron 26 kWh/100km 2 x (1%-74%) 9h:36m -21m Audi e-tron 55 Sportback 26 kWh/100km 3 x (12%-80%) 9h:50m Audi Q8 55 Sportback e-tron 24.5 kWh/100km 2 x (3%-81%) 9h:32m -18m Audi e-tron S 29 kWh/100km 3 x (2%-82%) 10h:05m Audi SQ8 e-tron 28 kWh/100km 3 x (16%-71%) 9h:46m -21m Audi e-tron S Sportback 28 kWh/100km 3 x (4%-80%) 10h:0m Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback 26 kWh/100km 2 x (1%-74%) 9h:36m -24m As the table shows, the 95kWh battery is still comparable to the new battery and even beats the larger battery because of a flatter curve for this distance.\nThe Audi Q8 e-tron charges up to 11 kW at an AC charging station or wall box. Audi offers an optional AC charger that supports up to 22 kW AC charging.\nUnder ideal conditions, using alternating current, the Audi Q8 50 e-tron can charge 0-100% in around nine hours and 15 minutes (22kW: about four hours and 45 minutes). However, the big battery’s numbers are about 11 hours and 30 minutes at 11 kW and six hours at 22 kW. Learn more in the onboard-charger section.\nThe Audi Q8 e-tron comes standard with the Plug \u0026amp; Charge function. At compatible charging stations, the vehicle authorizes itself when inserting the charging cable and activates the charging point. Billing happens automatically.\nThe new charging service Audi charging, which is set to launch in 2023 and will replace the existing e-tron Charging Service, will allow convenient access to around 400,000 public charging points across Europe. In addition, the e-tron route planner provides reliable support when searching for charging points along your route.\nRevised rear-axle motor and electric torque vectoring for better dynamics For the new Audi Q8 e-tron, Audi modified the asynchronous motor on the rear axle.\nInstead of 12 coils generating the electromagnetic field, there are now 14. As a result, the motor generates a stronger magnetic field with similar electricity input, allowing for more torque. As a result, the electric motor requires less energy to generate torque if this isn\u0026rsquo;t needed. This change lowers consumption and increases range.\nUpdated rear motor Audi Q8 e-tron With the e-tron range’s S model, Audi used a three-motor concept for the first time in large-scale production. Audi refined this setup for the new SQ8 e-tron. A 124-kW electric motor is at work on the front axle.\nTwo electric motors on the rear axle, each with 98 kW of output, separately power a rear wheel. This setup allows for a boost performance of up to 370 kW.\nThe motor electronics can distribute the drive torque across both rear electric motors between both wheels within a split second.\nRead more in the motor section for Q8 e-tron\nThe balancing act between comfort and sportiness The new Audi Q8 e-tron comes standard with adaptive air-suspension controlled shock absorption. The height of the car body can be varied by a total of 76 millimeters, depending on the driving situation.\nAudi adjusted the air suspension to optimize the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. Moreover, its electronic stability control (ESC) will allow for even more maneuverability in the future – especially in tight corners. The Audi Q8 e-tron handles these with noticeably more agility thanks to its revised progressive steering.\nThe gear ratio of the steering system was changed so that the steering responds much more quickly, even when making delicate steering movements. In addition, more rigid suspension bearings on the front axle support the effect of the direct steering ratio. Steering movements are thus transmitted to the wheels more directly, and feedback from steering reactions is also improved. In addition, Audi adjusted all chassis control systems, but they remain balanced and perfectly attuned – true to the Audi DNA.\nFurther improved aerodynamics With the Audi Q8 e-tron, the topic of aerodynamics was a top priority. By doing this, Audi could reduce the drag coefficient. For example, from 0.26 to 0.24 cw for the Q8 Sportback e-tron and from 0.28 to 0.27 cw for the Q8 e-tron.\nFor the Q8 Sportback, this means a reduction in consumption driving at 120km/h at 1.2kWh/100km, and for the Q8 e-tron, 0.6kWh/100km.\nThe wheel spoilers mounted on the underbody help divert airflow around the wheels. Audi enlarged the spoilers on the front axle, and the Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron now has spoilers on the rear wheels.\nAudi only mounted spoilers on the rear axle on the SQ8 Sportback e-tron.\nThe grille has a self-sealing system and electric shutters that automatically close the radiator. This system further optimizes the airflow at the front of the car and prevents undesired energy losses. The shutters only stay open when needed.\nAudi Q8 e-tron grille with shutters Convenient parking with remote park assist plus There are around 40 driver assistance systems available in the Audi Q8 e-tron. Up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors provide environmental information analyzed by the central driver assistance control unit.\nSomething new is remote park assist plus, which will be available to order starting in 2023. With its help, the Audi Q8 e-tron can maneuver into even the tightest parking spaces.\nCustomers can control the parking procedure through the myAudi app on their smartphones. When the car reaches its final position in the parking space, it automatically switches off, puts on the parking brake, and locks the doors.\nWhen leaving the parking space, the motor is powered on through the myAudi app, then the vehicle maneuvers out enough for comfortable entry.\nNight Vision is not available on the Q8 e-tron. The new Audi rings make it difficult to fit. So some Audi e-tron owners will miss night vision on the new model.\nDigital Matrix LED headlights The Q8 e-tron optionally comes with digital Matrix LED headlights. While driving on the highway, the orientation light marks the car’s position in the lane and helps the driver remain securely in the center in narrow spaces. Three other new features are also available:\nEnhanced traffic information The lane light with a direction indicator The orientation light on country roads Digital Matrix Luxury-class interior The glass panorama roof makes the interior appear lighter and reinforces the sense of airiness and expansiveness. The glass elements open and close electronically. You can also block sunlight with the built-in sunshade. When the panoramic roof is open, the two-part glass roof improves the climate in the interior thanks to efficient ventilation. An integrated wind deflector reduces wind noise as well.\nAudi also offers four-zone automatic climate control as an alternative to the standard two-zone automatic climate control and an air quality package.\nThe three-stage ventilation provides comfortable seating, even at high outdoor temperatures. Ventilation is available for the standard and individual contour seats with perforated leather.\nThe highly adjustable individual contour seats are the highlight among the interior options. In addition to pneumatic seat and backrest adjustments, you can order individual contour seats with a massage function.\nAll furnishings have optional decorative inlays of porous wood veneers such as grainy ash and sycamore, aluminum, or a carbon fiber structure for the S line and edition S line versions. New additions include light brown walnut wood and sustainable technical material made partially from recycled PET bottles.\nHigh-resolution touch displays and voice control Like all luxury-class Audi models, the Q8 e-tron uses the MMI touch response operating system.\nIts two large high-resolution displays – the top with a 10.1-inch diagonal and the bottom with an 8.6-inch diagonal – replace nearly all conventional switches and knobs. Beyond operation with the two-touch displays, you can activate many features through natural voice control.\nAudi Q8 e-tron MMI and Virtual cockpit The digital display and operating concept in the Audi Q8 e-tron include the standard Audi virtual cockpit with full HD resolution. In the virtual cockpit, graphics depict all the important aspects of electric driving, from charging performance to range.\nIn addition, you can also add a head-up display.\nThe Audi Q8 e-tron will come standard with MMI Navigation plus. In addition, its media center supports the high-speed data transmission standard LTE Advanced, and it has an integrated WiFi hotspot for the passengers’ mobile devices. Moreover, the navigation system intelligently recommends destinations based on previously traveled routes. On top of that, the Audi connect Navigation and Infotainment package includes car-to-X services.\nMaterials from recycling processes The Audi Q8 e-tron will be certified as net-carbon-neutral for customers in Europe and the USA. Audi also uses recycled materials for some components in the Audi Q8 e-tron. These materials, treated through a recycling process, reduce the resources used and ensure a closed, efficient, and sustainable material loop. In the interior of the Audi Q8 e-tron, Audi uses recycled materials for insulation and damping, as well as for carpeting. In addition, the decorative inlay above the display, called the Tech Layer, is available with a new anthracite-colored technical material partially composed of recycled PET bottles. With the S line equipment package, the upholstery for the sports seats is synthetic leather, and the microfiber material Dinamica. Audi makes Dinamica from up to 45 percent polyester fibers manufactured from recycled PET bottles, used textiles, and fiber residue.\nIn contrast to previous microfiber quality, the production of Dinamica is also solvent-free – another contribution to environmental protection.\nFurthermore, some safety-related components that partially comprise mixed automotive plastic waste treated through a chemical recycling process are used for the first time – specifically, the plastic covers for the seatbelt buckles. As part of the PlasticLoop project, Audi worked with the plastics manufacturer LyondellBasell to establish a process in which chemical recycling will be used for the first time to reuse the mixed automotive plastic waste in the series production of the Audi Q8 e-tron. In this process, jointly implemented with LyondellBasell, plastic components from customer vehicles are dismantled and separated from foreign materials, such as metal clips, before being shredded and processed into pyrolysis oil through chemical recycling. This pyrolysis oil is then used as a raw material to produce new plastics in a mass-balance approach.\nMarket launch in spring 2023 The market launch of the new Audi Q8 e-tron and Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron, which will be available to order starting in mid-November, is planned to happen at the end of February 2023 in Germany and the most important European markets. Audi expects that to come to the USA market at the end of April. The base price for the Audi Q8 e-tron in Germany will be 74,400 euros.\nVideos Below you will find some videoes of the new models. In addition, you will find more in the multimedia section for the Audi Q8 e-tron.\nAudi Q8 e-tron 55 s-line in Chronos grey Audi SQ8 e-tron in ultra blue WORLD PREMIERE! 2023 AUDI SQ8 E-TRON SPORTBACK - NEW NAME \u0026amp; LOOK, WAY BIGGER RANGE AND BATTERY "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/q8production/","title":"Audi Q8 e-tron production start","tags":[],"description":"On December 14, the first Audi Q8 e-tron drove off the production line at the Brussels plant. It marks the beginning of an era for the new top model in Audi’s electric SUV range.","content":" The plant has been a role model for sustainable production since the production of the Audi e-tron began. Around 160,000 units of Audi’s first electric model have been delivered since 2018.\nAudi Q8 e-tron production started december 14. 2022 Audi board member for Production and Logistics Gerd Walker underlines the importance of the brand’s new top model: “With its increased efficiency and range, as well as its sharpened design, the new Audi Q8 e-tron is a strong statement for electromobility.” Walker also highlights the outstanding role of the Brussels site as a pioneer for sustainable production: “Brussels has done valuable pioneering work. We are learning from our experience of having delivered around 160,000 vehicles worldwide. As the next step, we will leverage this experience to ramp up battery production in Ingolstadt. ”The battery assembly facility in Brussels is playing a groundbreaking role for the entire Group.\nUnlike many competitors, Audi focuses on transforming production from the inside out with the aim of heralding the future of production at Audi, the 360factory. Meanwhile, Brussels is a model for some areas of this innovative plant concept. To Audi, investing in existing plants is ‘sustainability in action’ – economically, ecologically, and socially. “The path Audi is taking conserves resources and accelerates our transformation,” Walker emphasizes. For Xavier Ros, Audi board member for Human Resources and Organization, Brussels provides valuable insights concerning targeted employee qualification programs. “The experience Brussels has gained since 2018 can be used across locations throughout the Audi Group.”\nAudi Q8 e-tron production started december 14. 2022 Audi Brussels CEO Volker Germann also highlights the role the staff have played: “Building the Audi Q8 e-tron will take more than just our entire infrastructure. Above all, it is our team of passionate employees who come together to make this car.”\nBrussels is a role model for sustainable production The Audi Q8 e-tron will reach customers in Europe and the United States as a certified net carbon-neutral1 car. From 2025, production at all Audi plants will be carbon neutral as part of the company-wide environmental program Mission:Zero. Named “Factory of the Future” in 2020 by the employers’ association Agoria, Brussels achieved this distinction as early as 2018. Since production of the Audi e-tron began, the Belgium site has been recognized as the world’s first certified carbon-neutral high-volume production plant in the premium segment. The site switched to green power back in 2012. Among other things, Audi Brussels installed one of the region’s largest photovoltaic systems on the plant premises, covering 107,000 square meters. The system generates around 9,000-megawatt hours of power from sustainable energy every year. That’s enough to charge some 90,000 Audi Q8 e-tron units and reduce carbon emissions by 1,881 tons. The companies that supply the battery cells are obliged to use only renewable energy sources for production. The electric traction motors for production are transported from Hungary to Brussels by green freight. Since May 2022, Audi has been using rail transport on the approximately 1,300-kilometer route, a decision that reduces carbon emissions by around 2,600 tons annually.\nAudi Q8 e-tron production started december 14. 2022 AUDI AG has owned the Belgium site since 2007. After acquiring it, Audi Brussels converted the plant to produce the Audi A1, a new addition to the Audi model range at the time. 2018 saw the birth of the Audi e-tron. In 2021, Audi Brussels produced 43,866 all-electric cars. Starting in the second half of 2023, more than 3,000 employees will also make the Audi Q4 e-tron here.\nThe new Audi Q8 e-tron with increased efficiency The new Q8 e-tron’s optimized drive concept, improved aerodynamics, and higher charging performance and battery capacity result in an increased range of up to 582 kilometers in the SUV and up to 600 kilometers in the Sportback (both according to the WLTP). Audi also uses recycled materials in some components for the Audi Q8 e-tron. These materials, recovered via a recycling process, save resources and ensure a closed material cycle that is both efficient and sustainable.\nAudi Q8 e-tron production started december 14. 2022 The below video shows the factory\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audiurbanshpereconcept/","title":"Audi urbansphere concept – Space travel in the heart of the megacity","tags":[],"description":"Systematically designed from the inside out, Audi has unveiled plans for the Audi urbansphere concept car.","content":" Designers and engineers initially created the Audi urbansphere for use in traffic-dense Chinese megacities, although the concept is also suitable for any other metropolitan center in the world. In these urban areas, where personal space is in particularly short supply, the concept car offers the largest interior space of any Audi to date. It intelligently coordinates this with technologies and digital services that appeal to all the senses and offer a whole new level of experience.\nAudi urbansphere concept “In order to meet the demands of our Chinese customers, Audi’s design studios in Beijing and Ingolstadt worked together closely to jointly develop the Audi urbansphere concept car,” says Markus Duesmann, Chairman of the Board Management at AUDI AG and responsible for the Chinese market. For the first time, potential customers in China could also take part in the development process, contributing their own desires and perspectives as part of a process known as “co-creation”.\nThe result can be seen in the Audi urbansphere concept and its particularly striking interior. The spacious automobile acts as a lounge on wheels and a mobile office, serving as a third living space during the time spent in traffic. To this end, the Audi urbansphere combines the luxury of complete privacy with a comprehensive range of high-tech features on board, even during the daily rush hour. Automated driving technology transforms the interior, in which a steering wheel, pedals, or displays are notably absent, into a mobile interactive space that provides a gateway to a wider digital ecosystem.\nAudi sphere – first class to the power of three Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and Audi urbansphere are the three concept cars that the brand with the four rings has developed to showcase its vision for the world of premium mobility of tomorrow. In the process, Audi is creating a vehicle experience that goes far beyond the purpose of merely spending time in a car to get from point A to point B.\nSphere number 1: The electrically driven roadster Audi skysphere concept debuted in August\nIt presented a spectacular vision of a self-driving GT that transforms into a self-driving sports car with a variable wheelbase.\nJust a few weeks later, Audi unveiled the second model in the sphere series, the Audi grandsphere concept, at the IAA 2021. This large four-seater sedan exemplified the brand’s ambition to define the future of progressive luxury.\nWhat both concept cars have in common with the Audi urbansphere is that the entire concept is based on level 4 autonomous vehicle technology. Audi is currently working with CARIAD, Volkswagen Group’s software business, to introduce this technology within the second half of the decade.\nInterior size Even at first glance, the Audi urbansphere concept reveals itself to be the largest model in the sphere family and of all Audi concept cars to date. Its grand dimensions – 5.51 meters (18 feet) long, 2.01 meters (6.6 feet) wide, and 1.78 meters (5.8 feet) high – place it in the upper echelons of the automotive world, yet the Audi urbansphere concept radically breaks with the conventions of the segment.\nAudi urbansphere concept This is because it has been systematically designed around its passengers, from the inside out. The most important dimension is the unrivaled wheelbase of 3.40 meters (11.2 feet). The interior of the Audi urbansphere is not subject to the conventional maxim of squeezing as many seats, storage compartments, and functional elements as possible into a space limited by the physics of driving. Instead, it prioritizes the occupants’ need to experience ample space as a distinctive comfort factor.\n„To make e-mobility even more attractive, we think about it holistically and from the customer\u0026rsquo;s needs,” says Markus Duesmann. More than ever before, it is not just the product that is decisive, but the entire ecosystem. That is why Audi is creating a comprehensive ecosystem with services for the entire car. The Audi urbansphere concept also offers everyone onboard a wide range of options to use that freedom to provide a highly-personalized in-car experience: communication or relaxation, work or withdrawal into a private sphere as desired. As such, it transforms from being strictly an automobile into an “experience device.“\nThanks to Audi’s own options and the ability to integrate digital services from other providers, the possibilities are nearly endless. These can be used to access a wide range of services related to the current trip. The vehicle also takes care of everyday tasks that go beyond the ride itself – such as making dinner reservations or shopping online from the car. In addition, the autonomous Audi urbansphere concept picks up its passengers at home and independently takes care of finding a parking space and charging the battery.\nCustomized infotainment offerings are also available, such as the seamless integration of onboard music and video streaming services. Audi will also offer customers exclusive perks, including access to concerts, cultural events, and sporting events based on their individual preferences.\nThe architecture – from the inside out Even the “sphere” in the name sends a signal: the heart of the Audi skysphere, grandsphere, and urbansphere concept vehicles lies in its interior. That makes the inner space the foundation of the vehicle’s design and technology and therefore the occupants’ living and experience sphere while on the road.\nTheir needs and desires shape this space, its architecture, and all of the integrated functions. As a result of this shift, the design process itself also changes. At the beginning of all discussions, the focus is solely on the interior. Only then are the package, exterior lines, and proportions designed, along with the technological specifications, turning the automobile into a complete work of art.\nSurface, form, function – the interior The doors of the Audi urbansphere concept are counter-hinged at the front and the rear; there is no B-pillar. As a result, the whole world of urbansphere interior opens up to passengers as soon as they climb in. Seats that swivel outward and a red carpet of light projected onto the ground next to the vehicle transform the very act of entering the car into an experience of comfort. A wheelbase of 3.40 meters (11.2 feet) and a vehicle width of 2.01 meters (6.6 feet) delineate what is a more than stately footprint, even for a luxury-class automobile. Together with 1.78 meters (5.8 feet) of headroom and expansive glass surfaces, these dimensions provide an exceptionally spacious experience of the interior.\nAudi urbansphere concept Four individual seats in two rows offer passengers luxurious first-class comfort. The seats in the rear offer particularly generous dimensions and a wide range of adjustment options. In Relax and Entertain modes, the backrest can be tilted up to 60 degrees while leg rests extend at the same time. The center-mounted armrests integrated into the sides of the seats and their counterparts in the doors create a comforting feeling of security.\nThe seats also cater to passengers’ changing social needs in a variety of ways. While conversing, they can turn to face each other on their swiveling seats. On the other hand, those who want some seclusion can conceal their head area from the person sitting next to them using a privacy screen mounted behind the headrest. In addition, each seat has its own sound zone with speakers in the headrest area. Individual monitors are also built into the backs of the front seats. When passengers want to use the infotainment system together, on the other hand, there is a large-format and transparent OLED screen that pivots vertically from the roof area into the zone between the rows of seats.\nUsing this “cinema screen,” which occupies the entire width of the interior, the two passengers in the back row can take part in a video conference together or watch a movie. Even split-screen use is possible. When the screen is not in use, it offers a clear view into the front thanks to its transparent design or – when folded upwards – through the glass roof area to the sky.\nAudi urbansphere concept Like in the Audi grandsphere concept, the interior of the urbansphere blends space and architecture, digital technology, and authentic materials into a single entity. The lines emphasize the vehicle’s horizontal proportions. The open, wide interior supports the impression of a one-of-a-kind space. The steering wheel, pedals, and conventional dashboard can be hidden during automated driving, which enhances the feeling of transparency and spaciousness. The seating surfaces and backs of the two seats with integrated seat belts are visually separate. Between the rear seats – normally locked in place in a low position – is a center console that swivels upwards. It contains a water dispenser and glasses – another testament to the Audi urbansphere concept’s first-class credentials.\nThe Audi urbansphere also qualifies as a wellness zone thanks to innovative digital options that emerged in no small part through input from the co-creation process with Chinese customers. Stress detection is a prime example – this adaptive program uses facial scans and voice analysis to determine how passengers are feeling and offers personalized suggestions for relaxation, for example with a meditation app that can be used via the personal screen and the private sound zone in the headrests.\nAudi urbansphere concept Less is more – displays and operation In the Audi urbansphere, simplicity has become a design principle. Neither circular instruments nor black screens for virtual display concepts are visible before activating the driving functions. Instead, passengers find clearly structured and calm zones made from the highest quality materials. Wood and wool, as well as synthetic textile fabrics, are used in paneling, seat coverings, and floor carpets, all of which have a high-quality feel and are pleasant to the touch. Soft beige and gray tones structure the interior horizontally. A dark, toned-down green serves as the color of the seat shells and soothes the eye. The interior color zones become lighter from top to bottom and, together with the natural light entering the space, create a homogeneous, wide interior.\nAudi urbansphere concept The vehicle comes to life at the touch of a fingertip, along with a number of displays, albeit in the form of projections on the wooden surfaces below the windshield, which can be surprising at first. Depending on the driving status – whether manual with a steering wheel or level 4 – they are either distributed across the entire width of the interior or segmented for the driver and front-seat passenger, displaying all of the necessary travel information in ultra-high resolution throughout the journey.\nIn addition, a sensor bar is integrated under the projection surfaces for quick switching between content – for instance, for music or navigation. It shows all the functions and applications that are active in the car. Icons flash for the different menus.\nOne particular, extremely innovative control element is located near the door cut-out on the interior cladding: the MMI touchless response. If the passenger is sitting in the upright position, far forward in his or her respective area, they can use this element to physically select various function menus via a rotating ring and buttons and click their way through the individual levels, allowing for simple and intuitive operation.\nEven if the seat is fully reclined, passengers can still make use of this convenient feature thanks to a combination of eye-tracking and gesture control. A sensor directed at the eye detects the line of sight when the control unit is to be engaged. And the passenger only needs to make hand movements that are similar to physical operation – without leaning over – to operate the system without touching a thing.\nWhether it is eye-tracking, gesture or voice control, or touch, the same thing applies to all operation modes: the Audi urbansphere concept adjusts to the individual user and learns his or her preferences and frequently used functions – and on that basis, it can not only sensibly complete rudimentary commands but also give personalized suggestions directly to the user. Control panels are even integrated into the armrests on the doors. That way, the car always offers passengers invisible touch surfaces using an optic indicator to show its position. At the same time, there are VR glasses in the armrests on the left and right doors that can be used in conjunction with infotainment options – for instance for the Holoride system.\nSustainability as a guiding principle Many of the materials in the interior of the Audi urbansphere concept, such as the hornbeam veneers, come from sustainable sources. This choice of material makes it possible to use wood that has grown close to the site, and the entire trunk can be utilized. No chemicals are used during the manufacturing process.\nThe seat padding is made of ECONYL®, a recycled polyamide. This material can also be recycled after its use in the automobile – without any loss of quality. The fact that the respective materials are installed separately also plays an important role in the ability to recycle them, as mixing them would drastically reduce the potential for recycling. Bamboo viscose fabric is used in the armrests and in the rear of the vehicle. Bamboo grows faster than ordinary wood, sequesters a great deal of carbon, and doesn’t require herbicides or pesticides to grow.\nSpace concept for the luxury class – exterior design A grand, undoubtedly self-assured appearance – the Audi urbansphere concept is certain to leave a lasting first impression. A length of 5.5 meters (18 feet), height of almost 1.78 meters (5.8 feet), and width of more than two meters (6.6 feet) are undoubtedly prestigious enough to rub shoulders with the automotive elite.\nThe flowing silhouette of the vehicle body features traditional Audi shapes and elements, which are combined here to create a new composition featuring the distinctive Singleframe, with the digital eyes of the adjacent lighting units, a widely curved, dynamic roof arch, a massive rocker panel that conceals the battery unit, large 24-inch six double spoke wheels (a reference to the iconic 90’s Audi Avus concept car) which convey lightweight design and stability, reminiscent of functional motorsport wheels and the Bauhaus tradition of the brand’s design.\nThe implied wedge shape of the vehicle body is emphasized by the large, flat windshield. At the front and also at the rear, there are large digital lighting surfaces that leave their mark on the design and at the same time serve as communication elements.\nThe Audi urbansphere defies classification into conventional vehicle categories. Nevertheless, it reveals itself to be a typical Audi at first glance. The similarities to the Audi grandsphere concept are particularly eye-catching. The monolithic design of the vehicle body shares commonalities with these two concept cars, as do the sculpted, soft shape of the wheel arches. A long wheelbase of well over three meters (9.8 feet) and short overhangs indicate that this is an electric vehicle. Elegance, dynamism, an organic design language – these are the attributes that immediately spring to mind despite the stately proportions of the Audi urbansphere, just as they do in the significantly flatter grandsphere.\nAudi urbansphere concept Visible technology – light In the front end, there is an innovative interpretation of the Singleframe that defines Audi’s look: it is shaped like a large octagon. Even though the grille has lost its original function as an air intake on the EV, it still remains prominent as an unmistakable signature of the brand. The digital light surface lies behind a slightly tinted, transparent visor that covers a large area of the front. The three-dimensional light structure itself is arranged in dynamically condensed pixel areas. The upper and lower edges of the Singleframe are still made of aluminum and the vertical connections are formed by LEDs as part of the light surface.\nThe entire surface of the Singleframe becomes a stage or canvas (known as the “Audi Light Canvas”) and can be used for communication – with dynamic lighting effects to clearly signal to other road users in order to improve road safety. Low beams and high beams are implemented via light segments in the outer sections of the Singleframe and a similarly functioning matrix LED surface is located in the rear.\nAudi urbansphere concept The lighting units to the right and left of the Singleframe look narrow, like focused eyes. These digital lighting units, known as Audi Eyes, echo the logo of the brand with the four rings, as they enlarge and isolate the intersection of two rings to form a pupil – a new, unmistakable digital light signature\nThe illuminated surfaces – and therefore the expression of the eyes – can be adapted to the traffic situation, environment, or even the mood of the passengers. As a daytime running light, the gaze can be focused or open, and the iris can be narrow or wide.\nA digitally created eyebrow also functions as a dynamic turn signal when required. Thanks to its outstanding visibility, it makes an unmistakable statement in the service of safety. One special tribute to China is a luminous accessory that passengers can take with them when they leave their Audi urbansphere – the Audi Light Umbrella, a self-illuminating umbrella. Inspired by traditional Chinese umbrellas, this one acts as a protective companion and multifunctional light source – the inner skin of the umbrella is made of reflective material, so the entire surface acts as a glare-free lighting unit.\nAudi urbansphere concept The Audi Light Umbrella not only gives users a better view of their path, it becomes more visible – when crossing a street or in dangerous situations, activating a rhythmic flashing of the luminous cone by means of artificial intelligence and sophisticated sensor technology. And the Light Umbrella also literally places its wearer in the best possible light, given that it evenly illuminates their face for perfect selfies whenever needed.\nDrive system and charging The technology platform of the Audi urbansphere – the Premium Platform Electric or PPE – was designed exclusively for battery-electric drive systems and therefore takes full advantage of all the benefits of this technology. The key element of the PPE is a battery module between the axles, which – as in the Audi grandsphere – holds around 120 kilowatt hours of energy. Audi has succeeded in achieving a flat layout for the battery by using almost the entire base of the vehicle between the axles.\nTogether with the large 24-inch wheels, this produces basic proportions that are perfect not only from a design perspective. The core benefits include a long interior and therefore legroom in both rows of seats.\nAudi urbansphere concept - 24 inch wheeels Additionally, the absence of a gearbox cover and a cardan tunnel increases spatial comfort in electric cars.\nThe Audi urbansphere concept’s two electric motors are capable of delivering a total output of 295 kilowatts and a system torque of 690 newton meters. These are impressive figures that are often not fully utilized when driving in dense urban traffic. Nevertheless, the Audi urbansphere is still equipped with permanent quattro four-wheel drive – an essential feature for the brand’s high-performance models.\nThe concept car has one electric motor on each of the front and rear axles which, by means of electronic coordination, implements the permanently available all-wheel drive as required, balancing these perfectly against economy and range requirements. One innovative feature is that the motor on the front axle can be deactivated as required in order to reduce friction and thus energy consumption when coasting.\nAudi urbansphere concept Fast charging, high range The heart of the drive system is the 800 volt charging technology. It ensures that the battery can be charged with up to 270 kilowatts at fast-charging stations in the shortest possible time. As such, charging times approach those of a conventional stop to refuel a car powered by an internal combustion engine: just ten minutes are enough to charge the battery to a level sufficient to power the car more than 300 kilometers (186 miles). In addition, the battery, which holds more than 120 kilowatt hours, can be charged from 5 to 80 percent in less than 25 minutes. This means that a range of up to 750 kilometers (466 miles) can be expected according to the WLTP standard – and even when used for more energy-intensive city and short-distance trips, it is generally possible to avoid making unexpected stops to charge.\nAir suspension for maximum comfort The front wheels are connected via a 5-link axle that has been specially optimized for electric vehicles. In the rear, there is a multi-link axle that, like the front axle, is made of lightweight aluminum. Despite the long 3.40 meter (11 foot) wheelbase, the steerable rear wheels provide excellent maneuverability.\nThe Audi urbansphere concept, like its closest relative the grandsphere, features Audi adaptive air suspension – a single-chamber air suspension system with semi-active damper control. It offers outstanding comfort not only on city highways, but even on the uneven, often patched asphalt of downtown streets with no noticeable body movement\nVideo of urbanshpere Detailed shot\nDesign video\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/secrettrials/","title":"Secret trials in icy Lapland","tags":[],"description":"Temperatures like the inside of a deep freezer, guaranteed snow, and enormous ice sheets - northern Sweden offers the perfect conditions for Audi to tune new generation Audi e-tron under extreme climate conditions.","content":" Raphael Kis and the new 2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype Developer Raphael Kis bestows rare insights into the closed off testing grounds and the workflow in the far north.\nThe snow crunches under Raphael Kis’ shoes as he steps into the street in front of his hotel, leaving behind one of the first sets of footprints. The air is crisply cold and the thermometer says -21 degrees (-5.8 Fahrenheit) on this January morning. The hum of snowplows is audible outside the hotel as they push the fresh snow from the frozen lake and prepare the test tracks just a few hundred meters away. Raphael Kis has pulled his black woolen cap low over his face and is trudging through the Swedish gloom toward the workshop. The paths are short: “You could say you fall out of the hotel directly into the workshop,” Kis says. It is 7:00 – time to start work for this family man who, as an Audi calibration engineer, is responsible for tuning driving characteristics like stability and traction.\nClosed off from the outside world The workshop is on the Volkswagen Group’s extensive testing grounds in Sweden – simply called “KALT 1” for reasons of secrecy. Fences completely seal off the area in Lapland and everything is strictly confidential. This is where Audi calibrates its future models on ice and snow. The testing mecca covers more than 3,600 hectares (8,896 acres) in total – about 1.7 times the surface area of the Frankfurt airport. Apart from several workshops with office workplaces and a hotel with 440 beds, the grounds offer wintery stretches totaling 83 kilometers (51.6 miles) in length.\nThe next-largest town is several kilometers away and even the nearest supermarket is beyond walking distance. Nonetheless, the roughly 150 employees on average, who are there only for Audi, are well supplied. The all-inclusive carefree package includes three mealtimes in the hotel restaurant, two exercise rooms, and a hotel bar. “We’re together with a lot of people – you have to like that. If you’re not up for that, you won’t be able to stand it for long.” Raphael Kis has been at it for 14 years, about 20 weeks per year, of which about ten weeks are in Sweden.\n2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype Fine tuning in the Swedish winter This morning, Kis is sitting in a workshop office and gearing up for fine tuning a new Audi model. The next generation Audi e-tron. Expected to be re-named Audi Q8 e-tron. When his son was younger, he explained his job to him this way: “Daddy sits in a car and adjusts it so that people can drive safely.” Admittedly, it is not quite so simple – and Kis dispels one preconception right away: “I don’t drive in circles all day long, as one might imagine,” he says and grins. Here and there, new software has to be run on the car and occasionally experts also have to adjust the hardware. Calibrating a vehicle takes over a year, usually one and a half winters: Kis and his colleagues ideally establish a baseline on dry road in order to adjust the basic handling. Test drives follow on a wet road surface before the Swedish winter sets in starting in late November. Ultimately, the car should drive harmoniously on dry and wet roads as well as on ice and snow. “The ABS, ASC, and driving dynamics control have to correspond to Audi DNA,” Kis explains. The automotive group thinks of its DNA as fulfilling certain criteria that characterize an Audi’s unmistakable handling.\nCalibration in dry Spain is on the agenda for February in order to “drive against it” again in Sweden, as Kis says. “It’s a constant interplay.” The new Audi model’s handling is also refined over the course of a year on mountain roads and passes. “The different road profiles should always be as customer-oriented as possible.” The suspension experts plan on doing the final fine tuning the following winter.\nAdjustments on a laptop Thick snowflakes are still fluttering from the sky outside the window, illuminated by the light of the workshop. “December and January are the dark months in Sweden – that’s pretty tough,” the developer says. This particular day, the sun came up at 9 AM and went down again at 2 PM. Kis says that February and March are the beautiful months in the northern kingdom. That is when the sun and the blue sky occasionally transform the testing grounds into a magical winter landscape. “But you also get used to the darkness. All the roads are well lit by roof-mounted headlights,” Kis says as he wedges his laptop under his arm and grabs the car keys from the desk.\nMoments later, the laptop is firmly in its bracket on the passenger seat of a car stickered with camouflage film. Various parameters can be changed on the computer in order to get incrementally closer to the target characteristics. The Audi should be easy to control – including in the threshold range. All control systems have to respond reliably to the driving conditions that are present. Superior traction is also considered a typical Audi characteristic. Despite electric cars, tuning has not fundamentally changed over the years.\nAdjusting behaviour Routinized driving on thick ice Kis’ next station on the testing grounds is a stretch on the frozen lake – about three kilometers long and with the same curves each year thanks to saved GPS data. Mounds of snow that were cleared off the route early in the morning are now piled up alongside it. Conifers on the banks groan under the weight of the snow and leave their branches hanging. How will the Audi respond to the icy roadway? Kis presses on the gas pedal and the car heads for the first curve to the left.\nThe Audi drifts through the curve and swirls the snow particles a good two meters up into the icy air. “These are the moments when the job is really fun,” says Kis. The handling specialist routinely steers the car through the course a few times until he has gathered enough information.\nHe does not need to fear that the sheet of ice will not support the car. At the start of the season, the team checks the ice with a snowmobile and measures its thickness. It needs to be at least 25 to 30 centimeters (9.8-11.8 inches) for a car to be able to drive on it. If the ice is too thin, hovercraft push the snow off the surface over and over. Given that snow has an isolating effect, the ice would grow more slowly otherwise. The result is a layer of ice that is up to 90 centimeters (35.4 inches) thick.\nAnalyzing the measurement results Back in the workshop. Analyzing the measurement results with functional developers and system partners is on the agenda after lunch in the hotel restaurant. A certain personal touch is discernible in the calibration, but Kis discusses a model’s target characteristics in advance with the development team leader and other colleagues. The nuances in their opinions vary widely from one to another. “What happens is that someone thinks that the car should oversteer a little bit more, for example,” says Kis. “But all in all, we have pretty much the same understanding of how the car should drive in the end.”\nDarkness has long fallen once more over the testing grounds when Kis takes his jacket from the back of the chair and slips on his cap. Quitting time after a ten-hour workday. “Dinner, chatting with my co-workers, and a video call home. Back at it tomorrow!” Kis says and disappears into the green light of the hotel lobby.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audidna/","title":"Why an Audi drives like an Audi - the Audi DNA in the driving characteristics","tags":[],"description":"It’s a feeling most people recognize immediately- This is an Audi! The driving experience is unmistakable, a harmonious balance of driving dynamics and ride comfort.","content":" 2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype and 2022 Audi e-tron S Decisive, in this respect, is a finely integrated interplay between the various components, whether that be suspension, steering, powertrain as well as brake and control systems. The driving DNA, that can be felt and experienced in every Audi, is defined in the concept phase of every model and then realized through both basic and final fine tuning. To achieve their aim Audi developers are guided by fundamental qualities that are used to characterize and assess driving behavior. These are: balanced, solid, controlled, networked, precise and effortless. The outcome is the driving experience that is typical of an Audi.\n“An Audi driver has to be able to feel it’s an Audi – in the form of harmonious, distinctive driving characteristics,” says Oliver Hoffmann, Audi Board Member for Technical Development. “The genes of the Audi feeling should be an unmistakable experience for the customer.” That applies to every driving situation, whether that be in stop-and-go traffic, accelerating away from urban areas, driving on twisting roads, changeable road conditions or even overtaking. “That is why the Audi DNA is also firmly entrenched in our electrically powered models,” Hoffmann explains. “At a computer, in the workshop and above all in extensive test drives, subjective and objective assessment criteria flow together in order to continuously sharpen not only the Audi driving characteristics but also the whole technical development.”\nObjective criteria support subjective driving tests An important segment of the test drives are conducted in bitterly cold northern Sweden. Here the emphasis is on finely honing the driving behavior in wintery conditions. Developers carry out subjective test drives, thereby putting their previously defined objective criteria to the test. So called “use cases” like, for example, emergency braking under wintery conditions form the basis of the tests driven. When the developers seek to tune a controlled and therefore predictable and stable driving behavior, objective measurements of initial deceleration and steering support the tuning work.\nStraight ahead stability, steering demand, and deceleration build-up are criteria for a rating methodology for ABS braking from various speeds on snow and ice. The results of tuning work flow into an assessment of driving behavior, which the developers document in the form of a spider web chart – a pattern that is applied to all Audi models on a model-specific basis. The foundation for that is the way that the vehicle and its individual characteristics are positioned and how the relevant driving maneuvers and development philosophy are defined. An Audi can be recognized by these driving characteristics: steering response, steering turn-in, traction, and steering properties. Here, the virtues of quattro are quite visible: its particularly unique driving characteristics with respect to traction in curves and straight ahead stability, as well as its steering and behavior during loads changes set the Audi all-wheel drive above the average level of the competition.\n2022 Audi e-tron S driving characteristics Precisely defined tuning philosophy Audi understands that a controlled driving behavior is defined by a precise and predictable steering response. To achieve these desired driving characteristics the developers follow an established tuning philosophy during test drives on snow and ice. This states that the vehicle should instantly follow the steering input upon entering a curve. Forgiving handling at the apex of the curve and low correction effort upon leaving the curve are also among the obligatory criteria.\nThe result: a predictable steering angle dependent yaw behaviour combined with a slightly oversteering balance, where understeer is avoided. Audi achieves these by using technologies like torque vectoring, the dual motor rear axle in the e-tron S, or the torque splitter in the RS 3. Developer Oswin Roeder summarizes by saying that “we describe the way that an Audi needs to drive by using objective and subjective criteria. But the subjective criteria are crucial for us as ultimately that is what drivers feel.”\n2022 Audi e-tron S Harmoniously tuned control systems, natural driving experience Each of the suspension control systems involved is precisely synchronized to the others. None of the systems dominate to the detriment of the driving experience. The driving experience is natural. Dynamic all-wheel steering is intentionally tuned to make a vehicle seem much smaller and manageable without creating a synthetic driving experience in the process. The systems built into an Audi are balanced and always precisely calibrated to one another. When customers order cars with air suspension, they automatically receive a steering tuning that is adjusted for the enhanced characteristics. That also applies to the combination of other systems like electromechanical active roll stabilization (eAWS), active suspension, and torque vectoring.\nFor instance, the electric quattro in the Audi e-tron S governs the torque on demand, from zero to 100 percent between the front and rear axle. On top of that, there’s electric torque vectoring for increased agility. Each of the rear electric motors distributes the drive torque directly to the wheel without any mechanical differential. This is done proactively in slippery conditions or when cornering quickly, before slippage occurs or the car understeers or oversteers. The result is highly precise handling, which can be adjusted over a wide range via the chassis control systems – from stable to sporty. In sport mode, for instance, the control systems intervene later to enable driving with more oversteer.\n2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback prototype Consistent system reactions, reliable driving comfort All of the vehicle systems involved need to respond consistently and reliably to the current driving conditions irrespective of the nature of the road surface. Ride comfort is a case in point. Finely tuned wheel damping avoids unpleasant phenomena like after-shake, shudder or shake, which are induced by road unevenness and often intensified by powertrain and wheel harmonic oscillation. The end result is the typical Audi ride comfort with vastly reduced secondary vibrations. The driver can hardly perceive interventions in the lateral dynamics; they are, at most, intuitively comprehensible.\nEasy car control, even at the limits of grip Drivers get a secure feeling of vehicle controllability if pronounced oscillation of the vehicle body is avoided when driving over large undulations. Therefore, tuning is intended to produce a car that is easy to control – even at the limits of grip. The underlying philosophy is to convey a feeling of consistent predictability in vehicle response. In the e-tron S, for example, the system engages the torque of the electric motors within only 30 milliseconds of recognizing the driving situation. Mechanical clutches are not utilised to apply torque in the electric all-wheel-drive system, instead electrical power is sent when and where necessary. The precision of this control systems’ interaction with the driver conveys a sense of safety. The steering is direct and gas pedal changes are immediately noticeable. It’s very easy to perceive how the vehicle’s character changes with the selected drive mode. Predictively recognizing driving situations, optimal interaction between subsystems\nThe mastermind of the regulating systems and control units is the Electronic Chassis Platform (ECP) with its integrated longitudinal and lateral torque distribution. It allows driving situations to be recognized predictively in order to adjust the vehicle as needed. It takes the speed, height values, the car’s vertical, roll, and pitching movements, the friction of the road, the current driving status, and understeering and oversteering into account, as well as information from the suspension systems involved. That network allows the ECP to ensure optimal interaction between the subsystems.\n2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron Sportback prototype Torque distribution in milliseconds and high perceptibility Audi aims to provide superior and easily manageable acceleration and deceleration in all driving situations. Audi lateral dynamics provide the driver with unambiguous feedback. When dynamically cornering, the front wheel inside the curve that has less load is slightly slowed down, which prevents slippage and improves handling. The electric torque vectoring in the e-tron S – the shifting of torque between the rear wheels – works similarly and particularly effectively. It happens in milliseconds and can engage extremely high torque for improved lateral dynamics. When the car accelerates out of the curve, the electric drive allocates more torque to the rear wheel on the outside of the curve and less to the rear wheel on the inside of the curve.\nSuperior traction, controlled handling – typical Audi Superior traction – especially in difficult winter conditions – and controlled handling are typical driving characteristics for Audi. An Audi should be effortlessly controllable, unperturbed even by the most difficult road conditions. Audi models are easy to manage, they feel both at home in dense urban traffic and on the highway, where they demonstrate unquestionably secure high speed stability. There is always enough power available for passing. To be able to make the best possible use of physical limits, the wheel brake at the limits of grip gently decelerates the wheel on the inside of a curve on the front axle of an e-tron S or on the front and rear axles of an e-tron. This strategy applies more drive torque to the tires on the outside of the curve and increases cornering agility. The traction control system (ASR) acts in milliseconds because Audi shifts individual functional components from the electronic stabilization control (ESC) into the power electronics directly on the electric motors.\nThe traits described form the framework with which Audi developers characterize and assess driving behavior across models in test drives on both wintery and normal surfaces. That is the only way to achieve what a customer senses when driving an Audi: This is an Audi.\nIn this interview, Carsten Jablonowski, Chassis Development AUDI AG, talks about the driving characteristics and suspension tuning of an Audi under different conditions. During the Winter Experience Drive in Sweden, the suspensions of the latest models were tested on snow and ice.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/updatedq4/","title":"Higher charging capacity and expanded online features for the Audi Q4 e-tron","tags":[],"description":"On the road with faster charge times and more connected features.

Used and processed lithium ion batteries function as energy storage systems – what are known as second-life batteries taken from dismantled development vehicles. That reduces costs and resources. This makes complex infrastructure with high-voltage power lines and expensive transformers as unnecessary as time-consuming planning procedures. The Audi charging hub\u0026rsquo;s battery-storage solution will bring quick-charging infrastructure where the electric grid is not enough.\nAudi charging hub Thanks to the roughly 2.45 MWh of interim storage, the charging stations in Nuremberg only need a 200 kW green power connection to the low-voltage network that is already available, which is entirely sufficient for operating the Audi charging hub. The 200 kW are enough to continually fill the storage modules. Solar panels on the roof additionally provide up to 30 kW of green energy. Customers can charge electric cars with up to 320 kW of power at six charging points. A total of about 80 vehicles can be charged here per day without reaching the limits of the energy storage system’s capacity combined with the hub’s 200 kW power input.\nThe Audi e-tron GT reaches a charging capacity of up to 270 kW. That allows the four-door Coupé to charge enough energy for up to 100 kilometers in about five minutes. A charge from 5 to 80 percent takes roughly 23 minutes.\nPrices like the Wallbox at home Currently, anyone who chooses to use the high-power charging stations at the Audi charging hub in Nuremberg and have an e-tron Charging Service contract can charge for 31 cents per kilowatt hour, regardless of the rate. That makes the Audi charging hub a real alternative to charging at home. “We’re providing people in urban areas with charging at the price they would pay to charge using the Wallbox at home,” says Hollmig. The Audi charging hub in Nuremberg is an open charging site. The entrance area is even accessible for drivers of cars of other makes.\nFast and uncomplicated charging Audi customers can use the new reservation function in the myAudi app: they can easily book one of the six charging areas.\nAudi charging hub reservation Charging itself is quick and uncomplicated. With Plug and Charge (PnC), it is even possible to charge models with Plug and Charge functionality without an RFID (radio frequency identification) card at two of the six charging points during the pilot phase. The authentication process takes place automatically via encrypted communication as soon as the charging cable is connected to the vehicle. To use this system, drivers must have a PnC-capable model of the Audi e-tron series (Audi e-tron 50/55/S incl. Sportback derivatives with production date after calendar week 48/2021) and an active e-tron Charging Service contract. Customers can spend the 20- to 30-minutes it takes to charge up to 80 percent charging volume – for instance with an Audi e-tron or Audi e-tron GT – in the upstairs lounge.\nAttractive service offerings enhance charging time The tests that are starting in Nuremberg focus on the new reservation function, customers’ expectations of a premium charging experience, and technical aspects like the requirements for modern battery storage systems. Audi also wants to determine which times of day the facility is particularly frequently used. The goal is to establish the Audi charging hub with appropriate added value for customers. To that end, Audi is offering additional attractive services on-site beyond charging electric cars: an exchange station for electric bike batteries, an electric scooter lending service, information about various Audi products, as well as test drives in the Audi Q4 e-tron and Audi RS e-tron GT, supervised by Audi experts. Additionally, Audi offers a just-in-time delivery service for food, an upscale automat, and mobile car care.\nAudi charging hub lounge Service staff look after customers In the roughly 200 square meter (2,153 sq. ft.) barrier-free lounge, which also includes a 40 square meter (431 sq. ft.) patio, users’ wellbeing takes center stage. There they can work and relax. On a 98 inch screen, Audi models can be configured or information about the Audi charging hub’s functionality or a car\u0026rsquo;s current charge level can be retrieved.\nDuring the pilot project in Nuremberg, an employee will attend to visitors’ wishes between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Six charging points and a lounge are available around the clock. “Our customers will share multiple benefits,” says project manager Hollmig. “With an exclusive reservation option, a lounge area, short idle time thanks to high charging capacity, and a novel swivel arm to simplify handling the charging cable.”\nAudi charging hub lounge Video presentation of Audi Charge hub The following video presents the Audi Charge hub in details.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/electromobilityinwinter/","title":"Electromobility in winter-Intelligent functions optimize range and charging performance","tags":[],"description":"Seat heating instead of a hot air blower, optimum tire pressure, parking in the garage, and selecting the efficiency mode these and other factors determine how quickly the high-voltage battery is drained – or not.","content":" Electric mobility in winter What can Audi customers do beyond the established tips to keep the high-voltage battery in their e-tron model working efficiently during the winter and to achieve optimal range?\nDeparture timer and preconditioning Preconditioning climatizes the interior of the vehicle before departure to the desired temperature like with auxiliary heating. Apart from comfort, it is a function that also ensures more range. That is because during preconditioning with the departure timer, the energy that is needed to warm the battery in the winter is directed to the vehicle during charging via an external energy source – for instance, a home wallbox or a public charging point. The result: less heating power needs to be used while driving, which in turn benefits range. That is particularly relevant for bringing the battery to a comfortable temperature without pre-heating for energy-intensive short trips, when not much time is available.\ne-tron route planner In the purely electric models, the Audi e-tron route planner complements the Audi MMI’s (MMI = Multi Media Interface) navigation features with about 30 pieces of detailed information and helps optimize the demands of e-mobility, especially when driving medium and longer distances: it calculates the fastest route, takes traffic and route data into account, considers the driver’s driving style, calculates how long it will take to charge the vehicle, and includes it in the total driving time. Users are also shown basic information such as the charging power or charging connections and the plug type of the respective charging points. The system also shows whether charging stations are available or occupied. The Audi e-tron route planner gives preference to high-performance HPC charging stations (HPC = High Power Charging = ultra-fast charging) and, in the e-tron GT quattro models, activates battery preconditioning while driving. With an active e-tron route planner, the particular model always looks for the most efficient path to its destination. Additionally, the range calculator on the website shows the differences in range for the Audi e-tron and the Audi e-tron Sportback – depending on external temperature, driving mode, rim size, and use of heating and air conditioning.\nElectric mobility in winter Charging at low temperatures The intelligent battery management system (BMS) communicates with the charging point or wallbox to optimize power for the gentlest possible AC charging. Charging is regulated automatically and the system ends the charge as soon as the battery is full or a predefined charge level of, for example, 80 percent has been reached. During the charging process, the BMS monitors the voltages in the individual cells and balances them as needed. Additionally, intelligent management engages battery heating. If the battery temperature falls below a certain limit, the BMS automatically reduces charging capacity in order to prioritize early aging of the battery. In all, slow charging has a positive effect on the lifespan of the battery. Additionally, it is advisable to charge as soon as possible after driving when the outside temperature is cold. That is because the battery is still warmed up and recharges more gently and quickly.\nRange prognosis in the digital instrument panel The range prognosis is derived from the high-voltage battery’s charge level and the energy consumption forecast. This depends on several factors. Drive system consumption has the biggest effect on it. Convenience consumers and air conditioning have far less of an effect. For the projected range, Audi distinguishes between two scenarios: the active navigation route and inactive navigation. For the active navigation route, the projected consumption from the route profile (speed limits, green lights, differences in elevation) and current traffic information such as congestion as well as average energy consumption over the last 100 kilometers (62.1 miles). Additionally, anticipated convenience and climate consumption are assessed for the entire upcoming drive. When navigation is inactive, the average of the last 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) is applied to determine drive system consumption. Convenience and climate consumption are also assessed. By turning convenience consumers on and off via the range monitor, users can see their direct impact on the range prognosis.\nHigh-voltage battery maintenance Anyone who frequently makes short car trips should charge the battery to a maximum of 80 percent in order to save its capacity for longer ranges and to extend its lifespan. On the other hand, it is a good idea to avoid a long-lasting deep discharge when the charge level is below 20 percent. Anyone who frequently makes long car trips can charge up to 100 percent, but should then start driving immediately thereafter. Ideally, anyone who does not drive for longer than 12 hours should keep the charging level between 40 and 80 percent in the winter.\nElectric mobility in winter Geo-charging profile This automated function in the Audi e-tron records in the vehicle that drivers can activate or load previously configured charging profiles at particular locations. Once location-based charging settings are set in the MMI and saved with the help of GPS coordinates, the charging settings and the timeframe for the charging process can be configured. Users can set charging profiles for several addresses.\nPredictive preconditioning In order to be able to use the Audi e-tron GT’s high HPC charging capacity of up to 270 kW, the high-voltage battery needs to be at a particular temperature. This is achieved by means of adapted preconditioning of the battery while driving. When an HPC charging station is entered as the destination in the e-tron route planner, an algorithm calculates the anticipated arrival time and deduces the necessary heating or cooling capacity from that in order to be able to access high charging capacity at the charging station right away for short idle time. If the customer wishes, the interior temperature is also correspondingly regulated.\nReducing driving resistance and convenience consumers Smaller rim sizes, narrower tires, and the right air pressure can reduce the tires’ rolling resistance in the winter. By contrast, roof boxes increase aerodynamic drag. Inside the car, steering wheel and seat heating save energy because they operate close to the body and consume less electricity. Switching to air-circulation mode reduces loss of range.\nElectric mobility in winter "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/thermalmanagementwinter/","title":"Intelligent thermal management in Audi models preserves range and performance","tags":[],"description":"In the winter, electrically powered cars have to bring the interior and the battery system to the right temperature. This double task already requires a lot of energy from them.","content":" Audi Q4 e-tron charging in winter Low exterior temperatures exacerbate the problem – and affect high-voltage batteries’ performance. Nonetheless, concern over excessive loss of range in electric Audi models is unfounded: with intelligent thermal management, the brand provides outstanding performance and range in its cars; special protective mechanisms ensure long battery life. In an interview, Pierre Woltmann, head of thermal management for high-voltage batteries at Audi, and Thomas Anzenberger from thermal management virtual functional development explain how the company with the four rings is effectively meeting the challenges of winter operation.\nDo drivers of electric Audi models need to be concerned about limitations in the winter? Thomas Anzenberger: I can answer that question with an unequivocal no. The size of our high-voltage batteries alone makes doubt about performance and range in the winter unwarranted. Our intelligent thermal management always selects the most efficient methods to heat the battery and the interior appropriately in the winter. As a result, high-voltage batteries have long lifespans, when our customers precondition for each season via what are known as AC charging stations or a home Wallbox. That function is particularly useful in the winter. It goes easy on the cells and simultaneously minimizes range loss because the battery is already in the optimal temperature range and therefore does not need to be heated as much.\nThomas Anzenberger How does the cold affect a high-voltage battery? Pierre Woltmann: The performance of a high-voltage battery is fundamentally dependent on the charge level and the temperature. The colder it is, the less power the battery can provide. Electrochemical processes are a factor in this. At cold battery temperatures, the battery’s electric internal resistance increases and the usable capacity decreases. We protect the battery by releasing less amperage at a lower temperature. Additionally, the battery can absorb the waste heat from liquid-cooled high-voltage components like the power electronics, the drive system, and the charger and be heated directly by a cooling agent heater.\nWhat are the effects of cold on charging? Woltmann: Charging can take longer at low battery temperatures. For that reason, the battery has to be heated during charging, ideally even on the way to charging. Upon connecting with the charging point, the vehicle automatically communicates with the power source.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how the charging point knows how much electricity the battery can absorb at any time. So we ensure that the battery isn’t overloaded. When it’s charging, the battery draws the electricity it needs for heating power from the charging point.\nPierre Woltmann What is the job of thermal management? Anzenberger: Basically, thermal management is responsible for distributing the heat flows between the drive system, the high-voltage battery, and the interior. Our heat pump system has acquitted itself well in this context above all. It converts energy from the powertrain or the surrounding air. That is heat that is available for the battery or, in the winter, for the interior as well. Using the surrounding air as an energy source is relatively new: we use it to balance the declining waste heat from the powertrain, which operates increasingly efficiently. That way, we have access to two mutually independent systems via the powertrain and the surrounding air, which we use to heat the interior and the high-voltage battery.\nHow is the temperature of the battery and the interior regulated while driving? Anzenberger: In order to ensure a reliable supply of heat even in very cold temperatures, our heat pump system, which is built into most of our electric models, integrates additional high-voltage heaters into the operating strategy. This ensures a comfortable interior even in extreme situations and quickly produces the ideal battery temperature of about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for maximum performance. A second electric heater is available in our winter package for the particularly cold northern countries. An additional heater for electric bicycles is also available as an option in some models.\nWoltmann: When our customers want to ride with maximum efficiency in cold exterior temperatures, the thermal management algorithm heats the battery to lower temperatures and, while it releases less driving power as a result, it also increases the vehicle’s range.\nWhat additional technical solutions has Audi developed to make the high-voltage battery independent of the effects of temperature? Woltmann: As a point of intersection with thermal management, we offer what is known as preconditioning, which has a positive effect on both the battery and the interior. It is possible to set the precise time of departure with the charging and departure timer – directly in the vehicle or with the myAudi app. As a result, the automatic charging process charges the battery to the preset level and a favorable temperature as close to the departure time as possible. This way, the loss of range is significantly reduced by heating the battery. In addition, preconditioning adjusts the temperature of the vehicle interior to the desired level prior to departure.\nAnzenberger: In the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT, conditioning for the charging process even functions automatically while driving in order to achieve consistently high charging capacity at fast-charging stations, namely when the e-tron route planner is used in these models. Depending on the outside air temperature, the intelligent thermal management system then additionally brings the battery to a temperature range that is optimal for charging while the car is driving and before charging starts, in addition to preconditioning.\nThis additional mobile preconditioning of the battery in the e-tron GT quattro and RS e-tron GT ensures the best and fastest possible charging results.\nAudi RS e-tron GT \u0026 Audi Q4 e-tron How does Audi reduce range loss by heating the interior? Woltmann: Compared with a combustion engine, an electric car has much less waste heat and energy available for heating. The heat that the battery, electric motor, and power electronics generate can be conducted into the interior with a heat pump. Basically, the heat pump works like a refrigerator – but in reverse. The more waste heat is available, the more efficiently the pump works. In the best case scenario, it can generate up to three kilowatts of heat output from one kilowatt of electrical energy. That technology is very useful particularly in the winter because it replaces a thermoelectric heating element. Depending on the external temperature, the heat pump can reach a higher range in comparison with conventional heating.\nWhat can customers who don’t have a garage available do? Woltmann : Anyone who needs more range as soon as they get into the car should precondition. Ideally, it should be done by AC charging, which is generally more efficient than DC charging because there is less power loss due to the lower currents. AC charging is also gentler because it doesn’t put as much strain on the battery. There is less amperage flowing with AC charging. The battery can absorb that even at very low battery temperatures, which means that the battery doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be heated as much. Charging should happen – regardless of whether it is AC or DC – immediately before starting a trip via the departure timer in order to use the higher battery temperature to gain range or immediately after driving in order to utilize the higher battery temperature to charge faster and more efficiently.\nAudi Q4 e-tron What happens to a cold battery at a fast-charging station? Woltmann: Regardless of the model, the algorithm in the vehicle recognizes when the car is being charged at a DC fast-charging station. The currents are released regardless of the charge level and temperature. With the active heating that we have implemented, we are significantly reducing the charging time in cold temperatures.\nWhen do high-voltage batteries reach their limit? Woltmann: To protect the battery, we don’t release any more electricity starting when the core temperature reaches minus 30 degrees (-22 Fahrenheit). But for that to happen, the car would have to be exposed to such an extreme temperature over a long period of time. Obviously it is also possible to drive an e-tron model with a sufficient charge level and a preheated high-voltage battery in external temperatures of minus 30 degrees.\nFrom a technical perspective, what additional advice can you give for the winter? Anzenberger: By using the car’s computer and the range monitor in the Audi MMI with range prediction while driving, customers can directly read how much range they are gaining when, for example, the interior temperature is reduced. The range can be increased with Range Mode. This slightly restricts comfort functions, drive power, and the maximum speed.\nRange mode in Audi e-tron GT Read more about thermal management You find details about thermal managment in our model section\nThermal Management Audi e-tron GT / Audi RS e-tron GT Thermal management Audi Q4 e-tron Thermal management Audi e-tron "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/vorsprung2030/","title":"“Vorsprung 2030“ - Audi accelerating transformation","tags":[],"description":"Audi wants to be a sustainable, social, and technological leader by 2030. The premium brand wants to offer electric vehicle customers an unparalleled onboard system with its own ecosystem.","content":" “The corporate strategy ‘Vorsprung 2030’ will ensure that Audi remains viable long into the future,” says Audi CEO Markus Duesmann. The pace of change in our society is rapidly increasing. That’s why we\u0026rsquo;re accelerating our own transformation.” A few weeks ago, Audi announced that starting in 2026, it would only launch new models on the global market that are equipped with electric drive systems. The company will gradually phase out production of its internal combustion engines between now and 2033. This clear decision was the result of an intensive strategy process with the ambition to continue to grow profitably.\nIn order to continue living up to Audi’s “Vorsprung durch Technik” (“Progress through Technology”) slogan in the future, the Board of Management spent the past few months formulating the company’s new “Vorsprung 2030” strategy.With a firm date now set for the company’s transition to e-mobility, the brand with the four rings is resolutely tackling its transformation. Audi embraces its role as a pioneer and driver of innovation in the automotive industry. “‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ remains necessary because we can only solve many of the world’s major problems, such as carbon emissions and global warming, through the use of clean technologies. We view ourselves as a company that guarantees the freedom and individual mobility of our customers,” emphasized Duesmann. That is why Audi is focusing on zero-emission drive systems. “We don’t simply develop technology for its own sake. It must be consequential and effective in keeping the world moving.”\nSpeaking at the “Corporate \u0026amp; Business” theme day during the Audi Media Days event in the run-up to IAA 2021, the CEO will be taking questions from the international press on September 1, 2021, including: What is Audi’s vision? How will the company change in the coming months and years in order to continue to drive technological progress and position itself for the future? What is the company doing to implement additional internal processes that promote further innovation? And what innovations and products can customers look forward to in the coming years?\nDevelopment of the new “Vorsprung 2030” strategy “Vorsprung durch Technik” has defined Audi’s DNA for 50 years. To ensure that this doesn’t change, Audi’s chief strategist Silja Pieh and her team developed a new process for creating a sustainable and forward-looking corporate strategy. Together with around 500 Audi employees from across hierarchical levels and from major markets such as China and the United States, she spent months analyzing more than 600 global trends in the mobility sector through 2030 that could become relevant to the company. This resulted in strategic areas of activity which the team discussed and evaluated in depth together with the Board of Management. Some of the insights are obvious – sales and profits will gradually shift, for example, initially from vehicles with combustion engines to electric cars, and later, when autonomous driving offers additional growth potential, to software and services.\nAudi charging hub “One thing our entire team finds extremely encouraging is that many employees and the Board of Management are already deeply committed to the issue of sustainability. We want to further emphasize responsible business practices in the future and rigorously adhere to them,” explained Pieh. The new strategy focuses on profitable growth and differentiation – and provides guidelines for prioritizing strategic areas of activity. This involves a number of different components, such as employee training, the corporate culture, and a new corporate management system all working in tandem.\nIn addition to the plan to phase out the internal combustion engine, more strongly differentiating Audi’s all-electric vehicles from the competition through quality and design as well as increasing the added value for customers play an important role. This includes a seamless ecosystem for electric and autonomous driving. As of result of the changes, Audi will be in closer and more frequent contact with their customers in the future, with new digital and physical offerings,” says John Newman, head of digitalization at Audi.\nAudi will also more closely align business success with sustainable activities on the basis of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria include climate change mitigation and the protection of finite resources, occupational health and safety, social responsibility, and corporate governance practices related to compliance and risk management. Pieh points out that the strategy process isn’t finished, but is instead an ongoing development process: “The world and especially the transportation sector are rapidly evolving. We will respond to changes even more quickly and with greater flexibility in the future.” As part of the group’s integrated planning process, Audi will regularly analyze and, if necessary, refine its strategic framework.\nThe automaker wants to prove that it is indeed possible to reconcile premium individual mobility and an uncompromising commitment to sustainability. Together with the Volkswagen Group and its other brands, Audi intends to play a leading role in the new mobility world. In its transformation toward e-mobility and software, the group’s concentrated creative power represents a decisive competitive advantage. In July, the Volkswagen Group redefined its priorities with its NEW AUTO strategy, which clearly supports the successful implementation of “Vorsprung 2030.”\nMartin Primus, General Secretary of AUDI AG, believes the advantage of this strategic vision is that it allows all of the company’s employees to focus on the upcoming challenges – both within the brand and across the entire brand group with Bentley, Lamborghini, Ducati, and Italdesign. Setting this course early on gives the Audi team the necessary clarity and sufficient time to complete the transformation. A restructured, strong foundation will facilitate its implementation financially, organizationally, and in terms of human resources.\nNew ideas for the future – innovations at Audi Audi space frame, quattro, matrix LED headlights, and numerous patents related to e-mobility – the list of Audi innovations is long, and will become even longer in the future. Oliver Hoffmann, Member of the Board of Management for Technical Development at Audi, knows that the coming years will bring further highlights. “In the age of new mobility, we not only define “Vorsprung” as world-class engineering, state-of-the-art design, and a captivating digital experience. We don’t just think in terms of vehicles. In the future, the focus will increasingly be on holistic mobility solutions, including the surrounding infrastructure,” he explained.\nThrough the “Audi DNA” project, the new Head of Development intends to place a strong focus on innovations that customers can experience. In this context, the company is taking a deep dive into technical details such as steering angle requirements, hand torque, and acoustics in order to develop a one-of-a-kind Audi feel for its customers. “We need to give our products a clear, unmistakable DNA. In the future, we will be very explicit in our definition of what driving an Audi should feel like. This also applies to highly automated driving, by the way,” Hoffmann noted.\nLike the entire company, Technical Development is undergoing the greatest transformation in its history – the most challenging decade in the automotive industry lies ahead. This includes the steadily increasing focus on software in the vehicles and autonomous driving. Alongside e-mobility, focal points of the Volkswagen Group’s strategy include enhancing connectivity, digital services, and expanding the use of internally programmed systems.\nIn the future, customers will be able to upgrade their vehicles and update or install subsystems as needed. Owners of vehicles with combustion engines in various countries will also receive exceptional service over their entire life cycle. “Our vehicles will be even more customer-centric, individualized, and sustainable thanks to intelligent hardware offered through our after-sales business,” said Hoffmann, explaining the decision.\nIn the new 2030 strategy, CARIAD plays an important role. The group’s software arm will develop a scalable software platform with a standardized operating system and cloud connectivity for all Volkswagen Group brands by 2025. “The E3 2.0 software platform will serve as the enabler of the synergies and innovations of the future, including autonomous driving,” explained Duesmann. While CARIAD is responsible for the technical implementation of software-based solutions, integrating them into the vehicle will be carried out by the respective brands in coordination with CARIAD.\nJürgen Rittersberger, Member of the Board of Management for Finance and Legal Affairs, explained at the Audi Media Days event just how he intends to lay the financial foundation to drive innovation within the Audi Group. “Here at Audi, there’s a specific mindset behind each and every technical innovation: we want to think holistically and always keep the societal and social context in mind.” To ensure that innovations remain affordable, the company continues to optimize its processes and costs. “In order to tackle a transformation such as the one Audi is currently undergoing, we must and indeed will free up the appropriate financial resources. This is the only way to ensure that we remain competitive and viable over the long term,” declared Rittersberger. In addition to results-driven volume management and strong operating performance, leveraging hardware and software synergies within the Volkswagen Group plays a key role in the company’s success. The first half of 2021 has shown that Audi is on the right track – a record number of vehicles shipped and significant volume growth in battery-electric vehicles prove that the brand with the four rings is committed to sustainable and profitable mobility.\nThrough its Berlin-based innovation unit Denkwerkstatt, Audi has been developing new ideas for the future for around five years. In the meantime, Audi Denkwerkstatt is widely recognized as one of the leading innovation units operated by a German company, and with its start-up atmosphere, is a “speedboat” used by Audi to develop innovative business models in agile teams. In addition, Audi’s intrapreneurship program sees employees from various divisions develop business ideas in just a few weeks. At the end of each stage, a jury of experts evaluates whether a project should be continued or stopped on the basis of predefined criteria. “Our goal is to quickly transform new ideas into customer-relevant innovations. Audi Denkwerkstatt plays a major role in this process,” emphasized Hoffmann.\nAt the same time, Audi is aggressively working on efficient manufacturing processes and smart technologies in production. In the Audi Production Lab, for example, the company is driving the development of cutting-edge manufacturing solutions. To this end, the team draws on a network of institutes, start-ups, and global suppliers – and above all else, relies on the expertise and creativity of its employees. Meanwhile, the Audi site in Neckarsulm plays a pivotal role as a pilot factory and real-world laboratory for the digital transformation. IT solutions and input from technology partners such as Amazon Web Services, SAP, and Capgemini are being incorporated into the Industry 4.0 project to create a fully connected factory here.\nAudi in China The Chinese market will continue to play an important role in the company’s new strategic alignment. Audi estimates that the market for premium vehicles here will grow to 4.5 million units annually by 2030 – in 2020, this figure stood at 3.1 million vehicles. Furthermore, electric vehicles’ share of this total could increase from 10 percent today to as much as 40 percent by the end of the decade.\nAs such, it is only logical for Audi to continue expanding its business in China. This includes increasing the supply of electric cars produced locally. Through its activities, Audi is helping drive the Chinese automotive industry’s shift toward sustainable mobility. The headquarters of the joint venture between FAW and Volkswagen is located in Changchun, where Audi has been manufacturing automobiles for over 30 years – in addition to other locations in China. Together with FAW, the company will expand its locally produced product range to twelve models by the end of 2021. The first products from the collaboration with Audi’s second Chinese partner SAIC Volkswagen will be launched in 2022. These will also be sold through the existing dealer investor network operated by FAW-Volkswagen Audi.\n“Our approach here is based on the idea of ‘In China for China’, and as such, Audi is focusing on the specific needs of customers in the world’s largest automotive market and actively driving innovation,” said Werner Eichhorn, president of Audi China. “Together with our two partners FAW and SAIC, we are well prepared for the challenges of the future.” To date, Audi has shipped a total of more than 7 million vehicles in the Chinese market, selling 727,358 vehicles in China in 2020 alone. In the first half of 2021, this figure stood at 418,749 vehicles.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audigrandsphereconcept/","title":"Audi grandsphere concept - First class toward the future","tags":[],"description":"The private jet for the road – At the IAA 2021, Audi is presenting the Audi grandsphere concept study.

That is because the technologies and design features assembled in it will turn up again within a few years in future Audi series. The Audi grandsphere concept illustrates the brand’s claim that it is becoming the trendsetter at the top of the automotive industry for technological transformation and completely new, holistic mobility offerings.\nThe electrically driven roadster Audi skysphere concept debuted in August 2021 – it was a spectacular vision of an automatically driving GT that transforms into a self-driving sports car with a variable wheelbase. These two concept cars – as well as the Audi urbansphere, which will appear as the third part of the trio in 2022 – are linked by their overall concept, which is derived from their ability to drive automatically at level 4. Audi is working with CARIAD, the Volkswagen Group’s software think tank, toward introducing that technology in the second half of the decade.\nLevel 4: not only does it change the interior space of the traditional driver-oriented cockpit and passenger seats into a spacious lounge as soon as the steering wheel and pedals are reduced. At the same time, it opens up new levels of freedom for all the passengers. That is because the Audi grandsphere not only frees the driver from the tasks of driving whenever possible, but at the same time also offers everyone onboard a wide range of options to use that freedom for individually variable experiences: communication or relaxation, work or withdrawal into a private sphere as desired. The Audi grandsphere concept transforms from being strictly an automobile in an “experience device.“\nThanks to Audi’s own services and the ability to integrate digital services, the possibilities are nearly endless. These can be used to access a variety of service options related to the current trip – such as designing a spectacular scenic route, as well as restaurant or hotel options. The vehicle also takes care of everyday tasks that go beyond the ride itself. For example, the autonomous Audi grandsphere concept picks up its passengers with information about their current destination and independently handles parking and charging.\nCustomized infotainment options are also available, such as seamless integration of onboard streaming from music and video providers that have been used previously. In an additional step, Audi will keep personalized and exclusive options available in the future – concerts, cultural events, or even sporting events that customers are invited to.\nThe Audi grandsphere concept illustrates the brand’s claim that it defines the progressive luxury of the future: for Audi, that includes the option of new high-class experiences, enabled by digitalization, as well as a holistic approach to sustainability with the goal of carbon neutrality in the near future along the entire value chain.\nFirst class for the future times three Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and Audi urbansphere are the three concept cars that the brand with the four rings is using to showcase its vision of progressive luxury. In the process, Audi is creating a vehicle experience that goes far beyond the purpose of merely spending time in a car to get from point A to point B, and even far beyond the driving experience itself.\nThese concept cars feature a new design that ultimately reimagines the interior, the passenger compartment, as the center of the vehicle and no longer subordinates the passenger experience to the requirements of the technology. This is reflected in the variable layout of the interior, the disappearance of the controls, and the sheer expanse of the cabin, in addition to linking them to new service offerings.\nThe design process – from the inside out Even the “sphere” in the name sends a signal: the heart of the Audi skysphere, grandsphere, and urbansphere concept vehicles is always the interior. The drive system and the handling are no longer at the top of the design specifications in this new generation of cars. Instead, the starting point is the interior, the occupants’ living and experience sphere while traveling. Their needs and desires shape the space, the architecture, and the functions. With that reassessment, the design process itself changes. At the beginning of all discussions, the focus is directed toward the interior and its design. Only after that do we design the package, exterior lines, and proportions that shape the car into a total work of art, along with the technological premises.\nSpace, form, function – the interior Audi grandsphere doors The doors of the Audi grandsphere concept are reversed so front and back touch; there is no B-pillar. The whole world of the interior opens up to passengers as soon as they climb in. But even before that, the Audi grandsphere has identified its passengers with a pathway identification – an innovative feature – that opens the doors and welcomes them with individually staged displays and ambient light. The driver and passenger positions are automatically detected and an array of personal comfort features – such as the climate control settings and the seats – are adjusted for the individual seats. At the same time, the infotainment system accesses the passengers’ most recently used services and seamlessly resumes them inside the car. For instance, a video that a passenger was streaming on a tablet is automatically played back over the display surface in the Audi grandsphere. On the driver\u0026rsquo;s side, on the other hand, the projection surface automatically picks up on displaying the news the occupant was reading before getting in.\nIn the interior, the lines on the decorative surfaces and functional elements are emphatically horizontal. The open, broad interior supports the impression of a unique space and the lack of a steering wheel, pedals, or conventional dashboard create a feeling of openness and breadth.\nThe large glass surfaces, expansive windshield, and transparent ceiling also emphasize that feeling. The same goes for the particular geometry of the side windows: their upper half is distinctively angled – the widest part is just slightly above eye level. It is a trick that Audi demonstrated for the first time in 2017 with its futuristic AI:CON concept car and which is now moving toward series production.\nThe change in the comfort zone is radical: if the boss’ seat is in the back in a conventional sedan, first class has now shifted forward into the front row. That is because it is no longer necessarily subordinated, first and foremost, to the driving function and the controls. In level 4 driving, the steering wheel and pedals disappear and the front area of the cabin becomes actual free space in all its breadth, with a perfect view through the large front and side windows, as well as maximum possibilities for movement.\nAudi grandsphere doors The interior appears particularly wide when the two individual front seats are pushed all the way back. The Audi grandsphere is a 2+2-seater. An upholstered, two-person bench with an armrest that goes around the side is integrated as a seating option in the back, while both front seats are designed for first class comfort and space.\nThe seating surfaces and backs of the two seats with integrated belts are visually separate. The side bolsters of the seat backs are discreetly bent, thereby ensuring support while driving through curves. The possible seat positions are optimized for every use: in the upright position, the Audi grandsphere can be perfectly ergonomically controlled – as desired and outside level 4 zones. With the back tilted 40 degrees, passengers can relax and use the infotainment system. Finally, if the back is folded out to 60 degrees, it achieves a perfect resting position. The headrest can be bent 15 degrees forward. Outlets for air that is filtered and temperature controlled – even scented, as desired – as well as speakers that are inaudible to other passengers and allow for a private aural zone are all integrated into this area.\nAudi grandsphere concept Between the front seats – normally concealed under metallic trim – there is a compact, onboard cooler with two glasses and a designed, elegant bottle for soft drinks. This is another sign of the Audi grandsphere concept’s first class claim.\nNo fittings, no screens: displays and operation One surprise when looking around in the Audi grandsphere\u0026rsquo;s natural-colored, reduced-design interior: neither batteries of dial instruments nor black screens for virtual display concepts are visible before activating the driving functions – the oft-cited digital detox at its finest.\nInstead, there are clearly articulated and sedate areas with materials of the highest quality. Wood and wool, synthetic textile fabrics and metal are visible and pleasant to touch as wall cladding, seat covering, and carpeting. Many of these materials, like the hornbeam veneers, come from sustainable cultivation or are made from recycled raw materials. There is no leather in the Audi grandsphere – even this is in keeping with a progressive understanding of luxury, which is always inseparable from sustainability.\nAudi grandsphere concept Another surprise whenever the vehicle comes to life at the touch of a fingertip: there are displays – but they take the form of projections on the wooden surfaces under the windshield. Depending on the driving status – whether manual with a steering wheel or level 4 – they are either distributed across the entire width of the interior or segmented for the driver and front seat passenger. All the information that is necessary while traveling is there in high resolution and precisely readable.\nAlternatively, the projection surfaces can also be used – in automated driving mode – as CinemaScope screens for infotainment content or even as screens for video conferences. In addition, a sensor bar is integrated under the projection surfaces for quick switching between content – for instance, for music or navigation. It shows all the functions and applications that are active in the car. Icons flash for the different menus.\nOne particular, extremely innovative control element is located near the door cut-out on the interior cladding: the MMI touchless response. If the driver is sitting in the active position behind the steering wheel, far toward the front in the interior, he or she can use that control to haptically select various function menus via a rotary ring and buttons and click through the different levels. A simple, intuitive operation.\nIf, on the other hand, the driver reclines the seat far to the back during level 4 driving, he or she does not have to do without these comfort items. That is because, at that point, a combination of eye tracking and gesture control are used. A sensor directed at the eye detects the line of sight when the control unit is to be engaged. And the passenger only needs to make analogous hand motions – without leaning over – that are similar to haptic operation and can use the system just as well that way – without touching a thing.\nWhether it is eye tracking, gesture or voice control, handwritten input, or touch, the same thing applies to all operation modes: the Audi grandsphere concept adjusts to the individual user and learns his or her preferences and frequently used menus – and on that basis it can not only sensibly complete rudimentary commands, but also give personal proposals directly to the user.\nControl panels are even integrated into the armrests on the doors. That way, the car always offers passengers invisible touch surfaces using an optic indicator to show its position. At the same time, there are VR glasses in the armrests on the left and right doors that can be used in conjunction with infotainment options – for instance for the holoride system.\nDynamic monolith – the exterior design At 5.35 m (17.6 ft.) long, 2 m (6.6 ft.) wide, and 1.39 m (4.6 ft.) high, the Audi grandsphere concept’s measurements reveal this sedan as an unambiguous example of the luxury class automobile. The 3.19 m (10.5 ft.) wheelbase indicates top value, which even overshadows the long version of the current Audi A8. But even more striking than what these figures suggest is the visual impression that it makes upon seeing it for the first time. That is because the Audi grandsphere looks nothing like a traditional sedan, but rather more like a tightly drawn four-door GT with a line the comes straight from the wind tunnel. And it does that while doing without any decor or superfluous flourishes.\nIn the process, the Audi grandsphere consistently implements the specific conditions of the electric drive system right in the front end – a short overhang, a flat hood, and the windshield that projects far forward as the foremost limit of the large interior. Nonetheless, unlike many electric cars, it does not look futuristic at all, but rather emphasizes traditional beauty ideals. The top edge of the hood is drawn far into the side of the chassis in a horizontal line, suggesting a long engine compartment – all characteristics of a GT. In the rear, that line continues at the same height across the rear wheel well, encompassing the whole cabin and emphasizing its size.\nA second horizontal line emanates from the bottom edge of the hood and runs under the side windows and likewise around the entire cabin. This subdivides the door surfaces into horizontally oriented shoulders and the convex verticals below them above the rocker panel. The wheel wells have a soft, yet distinctive shape – typical Audi. The slender rear behind the massive C-pillar is a quote from traditional streamlining. And the dynamically sloping arc of the roofline reveals the grandsphere as part of the Audi Sportback tradition. All lines and all surfaces seem to organically correlate, combining to form one monolithic body.\nAt 23 inches, the wheels of the Audi grandsphere concept quote an icon from the 1990s – the Audi Avus. At the same time, the six double spokes signal light construction and stability, recalling functional motorsport wheels and the Bauhaus tradition in brand design.\nVisible technology – light In the front end, there is an innovative interpretation of the Singleframe that defines Audi’s look: it is shaped like a flat hexagon. The interior surfaces, behind a transparent covering, are indirectly lit from above while driving – a distinctive, extremely three-dimensionally structured visual effect.\nThe headlight units on the upper side of the Singleframe look narrow, like focused eyes. The lighting units reference the four rings brand logo: they enlarge and isolate the intersection of two rings into a pupil – a new, unmistakable digital light signature. This means that the size of the light areas can be adjusted according to their function as daytime running lights or as dynamically staged blinkers – depending on the traffic situation – and thereby issue an obvious signal in the interest of safety. The same graphic is also in the rear lighting units – another significant characteristic of the Audi light design.\nAudi grandsphere concept Drive system and charging The technology platform of the Audi grandsphere – what is known as the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE – was conceived exclusively for battery-powered electric drive systems and therefore it takes full advantage of that technology. The key element of PPE is a battery module between the axles that holds around 120 kWh of energy in the grandsphere concept. A flat battery layout is possible because Audi uses the entire vehicle base between the axes.\nTogether with the large wheels, this produces basic proportions that are perfect not only from a design perspective. The core benefits include a long interior and therefore legroom in both rows of seats. Additionally, the absence of a gearbox cover and a cardan tunnel increases spatial comfort in electric cars.\nNonetheless, the Audi grandsphere does not forego the quattro drive system, which is essential to the brand. That is because the concept car has separate electric motors mounted on the front and rear axles that use electronic coordination to deliver all-wheel drive on demand and execute a perfect balance between driving dynamics and energy efficiency. The Audi grandsphere concept’s two electric motors are capable of delivering a total output of 530 kW and a torque of 960 Newton meters.\nFast charging, high range The heart of the drive system is the 800 volt charging technology. Like the Audi e-tron GT before it, this technology ensures that the battery can be charged with up to 270 kW in a very short time at fast-charging stations.\nAudi grandsphere concept with fast charging This strategy makes charging times that approach a refueling stop for a car with a conventional engine possible. Just ten minutes are enough to charge the battery to a level sufficient to power the car more than 300 kilometers (186 miles). In less than 25 minutes, you can charge the 120 kWh battery from 5 to 80 percent.\nTogether with a range of more than 750 kilometers (466 miles) – depending on the selected drive system and power output – the Audi grandsphere concept is unconditionally suitable for long distances. Furthermore, its range and charging speed keep pace with those of combustion engines, making it the perfect universal car for everyday needs.\nIn terms of dynamic qualities, the Audi grandsphere concept – as is typical for an electric car – truly outshines its rivals with combustion engines. Thanks to the high torque that is available from the first revolution, acceleration from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) takes just over four seconds; maximum speed is limited in the interest of increased range.\nAir suspension and active suspension for maximum comfort The front wheels are connected via a five-link axle, specially optimized for electric vehicles. In the rear, there is a multi-link axle that, like the front, is made of aluminum. Despite the long wheelbase, the steerable rear wheels provide excellent maneuverability. The luxurious Audi grandsphere concept touring sedan utilizes Audi air suspension – a single chamber system with adaptive dampers. Quite well suited for dynamic driving when necessary it guarantees gentle comfort without noticeable vehicle body movements, under normal conditions.\nThe reason: the Audi grandsphere concept has active suspension. The high-tech system can separately pull up or push down on each wheel separately in milliseconds via electromechanical actuators. That makes it possible to actively control the state of the chassis in every driving situation and therefore significantly reduce pitching and plunging when accelerating or braking. Thanks to the front camera, which recognizes unevenness, the adjustments happen predictively. The navigation system’s topographical data are also used to integrate curve radii, gradients, and inclines into the system’s projection.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/audiskysphereconcept/","title":"Audi skysphere concept – the future is wide open","tags":[],"description":"Audi has unveiled the first member of a new family of concept vehicles, a spectacular roadster. Audi skysphere concept is the name of the electric-powered, two-door convertible whose lines lead directly to the Audi design of tomorrow.","content":" Audi skysphere concept With it, the brand is illustrating its vision for the progressive luxury segment of the future, in which the interior becomes an interactive space and the vehicle a platform for captivating experiences. This is being made possible thanks to autonomous driving, a revolutionary redesign of the interior, and a seamless digital ecosystem.\nThe Audi skysphere concept shows how the brand is redefining luxury in the future – it’s no longer just about driving. The concept car was designed with the clear objective of offering its occupants captivating and world-class experiences.\nTo give passengers the maximum amount of freedom, the Audi skysphere concept was designed for two different driving experiences: a grand touring experience and a sports experience. This makes use of a spectacular technical detail – the variable wheelbase. Electric motors and a sophisticated mechanism with body and frame components that slide into one another make it possible to vary the wheelbase itself and the exterior length of the car by 250 millimeters. At the same time, the vehicle’s ground clearance is adjusted by 10 millimeters to enhance comfort and driving dynamics.\nAudi skysphere concept sport mode With the touch of button, the driver can take advantage of their freedom and choose their own driving experience– either they pilot their 4.94-meter-long e-roadster themselves in “Sports” mode with a reduced wheelbase, while the rear-wheel steering ensures that the vehicle remains extremely agile despite its dimensions. Or they can choose to be chauffeured around in a 5.19-meter GT in the autonomous “Grand Touring” driving mode while enjoying the sky and the scenery, maximum legroom, and the services offered by a seamlessly integrated digital ecosystem.\nAudi skysphere concept Grand Touring mode In this mode, the steering wheel and pedals move into an invisible area; the feeling of space in the concept car opens up completely new realms of possibility for such a sporty convertible. Meanwhile, the Audi skysphere automatically keeps an eye on the road and traffic with its sensor system and drives the occupants safely to their destination.\nSimilar to how the interior design offers a new, contemporary interpretation of luxury, digitization and the ecosystem open up unprecedented levels of freedom and worlds of experience for the vehicle’s passengers. Thanks to Audi’s own services and the ability to integrate digital services, the possibilities are nearly endless. In addition, the passengers can share their experience on the road with friends via social media, with images of the interior and the surrounding area. The vehicle also takes care of everyday tasks that go beyond the ride itself. For example, the autonomous Audi skysphere concept picks up its passengers with information about their current destination and independently handles parking and charging.\nAudi skysphere to be unveiled on its home turf in California The Audi skysphere concept will make its public debut on August 13, 2021, as part of Monterey Car Week – on the legendary fairways of the Pebble Beach golf course. This means the vehicle’s unveiling in California is taking place more or less on its home turf. This is because the concept car was conceived and designed at the Audi Design Studio in Malibu, just a stone’s throw away from the Pacific Coast Highway, the legendary coastal road that connects the suburbs of Los Angeles with northern California. Studio manager Gael Buzyn and his team are the creative minds behind the project. A legendary classic model from the company’s own history – the Horch 853 roadster – served as the inspiration for the new groundbreaking model. The impressive convertible, which is also around 5.20 meters in length, was not only the definition of modern luxury in the 1930s, but also won the Concours d’Elegance in Pebble Beach in 2009.\nBut the visual inspiration from its predecessor is limited to the concept car’s dimensions and typical proportions with a rather compact cabin and long front end. A look under the hood of the Horch reveals an imposing straight-eight engine with a displacement of 5 liters. The Audi skysphere, on the other hand, mainly has electric drive components between the front axle and the windshield, such as the charger and the DC/DC converter, plus the actuators and electronic and mechanical components for the adaptive wheelbase. It also features a spacious trunk filled with two golf bags specially designed for the concept car.\nThe drive system: 465 kW of power “New technologies like electrification, digitalization, and autonomous driving gave us the opportunity to create an experience that goes way beyond the one that typical roadsters offer today,” said design project manager Gael Buzyn.\nAn electric motor positioned on the powered rear axle is responsible for delivering power to the wheels of the Audi skysphere. A total of 465 kilowatts of power and 750 Newton meters of torque have an easy time with the roadster, which only weighs around 1,800 kilograms. The weight distribution of around 60 percent on the powered rear axle results in ample traction and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just four seconds, if required.\nThe Audi skysphere’s battery modules are primarily positioned behind the cabin – an ideal configuration for the vehicle’s center of gravity and agility. Further modules can be found between the seats in the center tunnel of the skysphere interior – another position chosen in favor of vehicle dynamics. The battery’s capacity is expected to be more than 80 kWh, giving the car a range of more than 500 kilometers according to the WLTP standard, at least in the economical GT mode.\nThe chassis: rear-wheel steering and adaptive air suspension The vehicle features double wishbone axles in the front and the rear. The upper and lower wishbones are forged or cast from aluminum. Steering takes place via a steer-by-wire system that controls both the front and the rear wheels. Because the system is not mechanically connected to the front axle, the driver can select different steering ratios and steering settings – all at the touch of a button. This allows the steering to be adjusted from extremely direct to comfortable, but also from high self-aligning forces to minimal self-aligning forces, for example when parking. The rear-axle steering and adaptive wheelbase also contribute to the car’s small turning radius.\nAudi skysphere concept A long-established Audi chassis technology ensures that the suspension delivers the necessary level of versatility – the latest evolutionary stage of Audi’s adaptive air suspension has been implemented in the concept car and features three independent air chambers to provide a comfortable base suspension. Individual chambers can be deactivated for a more sporty ride with fast acceleration. The result is that the characteristic curve of the spring becomes more progressive, reducing roll and pitch to a minimum. Lowering the body by 10 mm reduces aerodynamic drag – particularly relevant when driving long distances. The Audi skysphere’s active suspension plays a key role in the versatility of the car’s handling characteristics. When simply coasting along, the individual wheels are selectively raised or lowered to compensate for unevenness and undulations in the road surface – the result of a symbiosis between the navigation system’s digital predictions and the active chassis’ sophisticated control and actuation systems. Mounted on aerodynamically styled 23-inch alloy rims, the 285/30 tires strike a perfect balance between suitability for long-distance trips thanks to minimal rolling resistance and a sporty, active driving style with high longitudinal and lateral acceleration.\nThe exterior: reverence without retro When it comes to their footprint – 5.23 meters in length versus 5.19; a width of 1.85 versus 2.00 meters – it is easy to see the similarity between the legendary Horch 853 convertible and the Audi skysphere. A striking difference, on the other hand, can be found in their height – the legendary Horch, with its iconic design, towered up to 1.77 meters depending on the body shape, while its autonomous descendant, the Audi skysphere, ducks down to the road in Sport mode at 1.23 meters flat, with an optimized center of gravity and aerodynamics. The concept car pays its respects to the classic model without merely remaining a retro imitation.\nAfter all, apart from its dimensions, it’s the lines that make a real difference. With its wide curved and flared wheel arches typical of the brand, the skysphere emphasizes the wide track – a visible indication of its dynamic talents. Viewed from the side, the proportions are impressive with a long hood and – especially at the front – a short overhang. The surfaces of the wheel arches and front hood are organically curved. The rear end was developed in a wind tunnel and combines elements of a speedster and a shooting brake with large glass surfaces in a traditional streamlined design. Two overnight bags designed specifically for the Audi skysphere find space under the glass, and are held in place with straps that are stretched in a crosswise pattern.\nThe front end – although no longer serving as a radiator grill – clearly features the brand’s typical Singleframe and the three-dimensionally designed, illuminated emblem with the four rings. The entire Singleframe and also the adjacent surfaces on the sides are designed with white LED elements to literally act as a stage for visual effects – both functional effects as well as moving welcome sequences when the vehicle is opened and closed.\nGentle dimming and a structured, rhythmically pulsating light produce an elegant effect. The daytime running lights in the side front sections, in turn, give the lighting units a resolute, focused “gaze.” If the wheelbase is changed, the LEDs in the front and rear display a specially composed dynamic sequence.\nThe rear end is also dominated by a digitally controlled LED surface that extends across the entire width of the vehicle. Countless red LEDs are scattered like rubies across the vertical rear surface. Reflections create dynamic lighting and shadow effects when the lighting units are switched on and off.\nAudi skysphere concept Upon changing the wheelbase and thus the operating mode from GT to Sport, the light signature also changes and sends a clear indication of the changed character of the Audi skysphere concept, particularly in the area around the Singleframe.\nA characteristic feature of the side view are the rocker panels, which seem to protrude into the rear wheel arch – a necessary feature when varying the wheelbase actually pushes it backwards. The rocker panel is attached to the front end of the car, and as it moves, the panel also slides to the rear under the fixed door. In the process, the wheelbase is reduced from the standard size of an A8 L to the significantly more compact size of the curve-compatible Audi RS 5 – 25 centimeters make all the difference. And not just technically, but also visually and, above all, in terms of the driving experience.\nThere’s no doubt that the Audi skysphere concept has two personalities – a GT and a luxury sports car. The key differences, however, can only be enjoyed in the interior, because here, behind the rear-hinged and wide-opening doors, the Audi skysphere offers highly contrasting experiences.\nThe interior: two spheres of experience in one When it comes to the three upcoming concept cars Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and Audi urbansphere, the brand is placing the space that surrounds the passengers (“sphere”) and which becomes an experience for them – the interior – at the center of its designs. This is because all three vehicles are designed for level 4 autonomous driving – meaning that in certain defined road and traffic situations, the driver can delegate complete responsibility to the car and no longer has to intervene.\nAs a result, control elements such as the steering wheel and pedals can be swiveled into an invisible position and thereby completely removed from the interior. And passengers, including the one in the front left seat, can enjoy a new form of freedom – the freedom to relax in the open air, enjoy the scenery and the wind, or interact with the Internet and the world thanks to the connection with the digital ecosystem in the Audi skysphere.\nAudi skysphere concept Free of controls, the interior appears as a light, spacious environment, inspired in many areas by the Art Deco universe. The comfortable seats boast the visual elegance of designer furnishings, yet they fulfill the functions of an car seat in driving mode without any compromises – side support and safety features are part of the package. They are upholstered in sustainably produced microfiber fabric and, thanks to their variable position in the interior, offer the kind of freedom to move and legroom that can otherwise only be experienced when flying first class on an airplane. Environmentally certified eucalyptus wood and synthetically produced imitation leather are other sustainably manufactured materials that contribute to creating an unparalleled experience in the vehicle’s interior.\nShould the Audi skysphere concept be used in driver-operated mode, then the interior transforms into an ergonomically perfect driving machine cockpit. Together with the chassis and body, the instrument panel and the monitor panel on the center console also move to the rear. The driver finds all the controls, including the steering wheel and pedals, in the position that best suits them.\nLarge touch monitor surfaces – 1415 mm wide, 180 mm high – on the dashboard and in the upper area of the center console are used to operate the vehicle and infotainment systems. In Grand Touring mode, this can be used to display content from the Internet, video conferences, or streamed movies. Small touch panels in the doors are used to operate the air conditioning.\nA high-quality sound system – befitting of this luxury convertible – delivers concert hall audio quality even when the vehicle is in motion. The speakers are hidden behind the door panels; a few more in the rear interior wall even produce surround sound. The shape of the headrests prevents turbulence and also annoying wind noise.\nThe vehicle experience: luxury without limits Audi skysphere, Audi grandsphere, and, coming in 2022, Audi urbansphere are the three concept cars that the brand with the four rings is using to showcase its vision of progressive luxury. In the process, Audi is creating a vehicle experience that goes far beyond the purpose of merely spending time in a car to get from point A to point B, and even far beyond the driving experience itself.\nThese concept cars feature a new design that ultimately reimagines the interior, the passenger compartment, as the center of the vehicle and no longer subordinates the passenger experience to the requirements of the technology. This is reflected in the variable layout of the interior, the disappearance of the controls, and the sheer expanse of the cabin. In Grand Touring mode, this not only allows both passengers to enjoy a smooth and pleasant journey, but also combines it with new service offerings. These can be used to access a variety of service options related to the current trip – such as designing a spectacular scenic route, as well as restaurant or hotel options.\nCustomized infotainment options are also available, such as linking the on-board streaming service to music and video providers used at home. And in a further step, Audi also aims to provide personalized and exclusive options for users of its luxury cars in the future – such as concerts, cultural events, or even sporting events that are only available upon special invitation. In this way, a vehicle like the Audi skysphere concept will become a platform for experiences that expand horizons beyond the mere ride in just a few years.\n"},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/_header/","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":" docs "},{"uri":"https://electrichasgoneaudi.net/articles/about/","title":"About electrichasgoneaudi.net","tags":[],"description":"The goal for Electrichasgoneaudi.net is to be the ultimate site for information about all-electric Audis.","content":" The target audience is everyone owning, everyone considering buying, and everyone wanting to learn about all-electric Audis\nThe site is community-driven and open-source, managed by owners, and updated by anyone with a Github account.\nWhat type of content do you find?
