the next step in the design language of the <a href=..>electric Audi models</a>.</p><p>Its sporty character emerges from the striking proportions – thanks to short front overhangs, large wheels, a broad track and powerfully toned muscles. All lines are drawn with the maximum precision, and the surface treatment has a clear, pared-back effect.</p><p>The high, upright front symbolizes the robustness and strength of the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. Their dominant element is the large Singleframe – with its eight corners, it is characteristic of an SUV from Audi. A new feature that is typical for electric vehicles is the enclosed Singleframe and the inverted color design: The chrome frame is bordered by a wide mask in a dark contrasting paint finish, a structured surface with horizontal inserts forms the insert for the radiator grille. The Four Rings integrate various sensors as a full-surface element which then disappear behind the brand logo – a new feature at Audi. A powerfully contoured, curved blade extends under the Singleframe, running sharply up at the ends.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--6bc8f6c85dafe9685f00d4e2d716f3d9><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/paint/paint_typhoongrey_6s.jpg data-pswp-width=800 data-pswp-height=533 target=_blank><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/paint/paint_typhoongrey_6s_st.jpg class=img-fluid alt="Audi Q4 Sportback" title="Audi Q4 Sportback" width=800 height=533 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Audi Q4 Sportback</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>

  </script><p>When viewed from the side, the unusually flat A-pillars catch the eye – and provide the entire greenhouse with an elegant flow. The roofline stretches low over the body, ending on the Sportback in a long D-pillar. The third side window rises up in an opposing direction – a typical feature of the Sportback. The top of the window points toward the spoiler, which sits on the lower section of the split rear window. On the Q4 e-tron, which has a roof edge spoiler that finishes off the powerful D-pillar, a black insert strip runs across the whole of the roofline. It separates the rear end of the roof visually from the rest of the body and makes it appear to float – an effect that accentuates the sporty character of the vehicle.</p><p>The sides of both electric SUVs feature taut contours. In both models, the external mirrors sit on the door rail in the style of a sports car. The doors feature overlapping horizontal edges that create an interplay of light and shadow. In the lower area of the doors, striking contours hint at the high-voltage battery pack, the vehicle’s beating heart. The muscular blisters, which extend across the wheel housings, highlight the wheels in a powerful expression and point to Audi’s quattro expertise. They feature a slightly softer and more flowing design than on the models with a combustion engine. The rear blisters run around the D-pillars and into the luggage compartment cover.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--3771fdbc99e044d4fbc98fdd53288c30><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/paint/paint_typhoongrey_1.jpg data-pswp-width=2470 data-pswp-height=1372 target=_blank><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/paint/paint_typhoongrey_1_st.jpg class=img-fluid alt="Audi Q4 Typhoon Grey" title="Audi Q4 Typhoon Grey" width=800 height=444 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Audi Q4 Typhoon Grey</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>

  </script><p>Horizontal lines emphasize the width across the whole of the rear section, while the raised diffusor creates a powerful, sporty accent. An e-tron logo is embossed in the bumper, another one in the Singleframe</p><p>The color swatch for the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron contains eight colors. Their restrained character is inspired by the colors and hues found in nature. The solid paint color is called <a href=exterior/paint/#pebble-stone-gray>stone gray</a>, the metallic shades are named <a href=exterior/paint/#aurora-violett>aurora violet</a> (new), <a href=exterior/paint/#floret-silver>floret silver</a>, <a href=exterior/paint/#geyser-blue>geyser blue</a>, <a href=exterior/paint/#glacier-white>glacier white</a>, <a href=exterior/paint/#mythos-black>mythos black</a>, <a href=exterior/paint/#navarra-blue>Navarra blue</a>, and <a href=exterior/paint/#typhoon-grey>typhoon gray</a>.

On the basic vehicle, the wheel arches, the lower section of the bumper, and the diffusor feature an anthracite grain, the gloss package accentuate the side windows.</p><p>The Singleframe also differs depending on the line – on the S line, chrome elements lend it its own distinctive look. Here, and also in the advanced line, the lower add-on parts feature a contrasting paint finish in metallic Manhattan gray; in the optional <a href=exterior/paint/#full-body-paint>full paint finish</a> customers can choose between four colors, while there are also 19- and 20-inch aluminum wheels.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--23b7f13605a4e110a0c807dd4da34953><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/optics/optics_black_1.jpg data-pswp-width=2100 data-pswp-height=1500 target=_blank><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/exterior/optics/optics_black_1_st.jpg class=img-fluid alt="Black optics" title="Black optics" width=800 height=571 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Black optics</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>

Apart from the basic version, these are aluminum wheels, and each size includes especially aerodynamic designs. In the 20-inch category, two wheels come from Audi Sport GmbH, which provides all four in the 21-inch class. One of them comes in a matte bronze finish, another in platin gray. The third is an Aero wheel, which is largely covered with black plastic inlays.</p><p>All motor line-ups drive off the assembly line with a mix of tires, which further enhances stability and the sporty character. The front tires are 235 millimeters wide throughout, the rear tires 255 millimeters, while the cross sections differ depending on the rim size. All tires are optimized for rolling resistance, the 21-inch class includes a decidedly sporty tire variant for the Sportback</p><p>Learn more about the exterior details and see high-resolution pictures of the exterior in the <a href=exterior>Audi Q4 e-tron exterior section</a></p><h2 id=audi-q4-e-tron-interior>Audi Q4 e-tron interior</h2><p>The new era of technology on which Audi has embarked can also be experienced in the interior of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. The instrument panel introduces itself with progressive elegance and underlines the airy feeling of spaciousness. The cockpit features a distinctly three-dimensional design, and its geometric volumes are interrelated in an electrifying way.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/interior/interior2s.jpg alt=Interior></p><p>In both the electric SUVs, the operating and display units take on the function of design elements more than ever. The digital instrument for the driver is embedded like a diamond between two volumes – a short one on the left-hand side, which incorporates an air vent, and a long one on the right-hand side. It extends all the way to the front passenger door and integrates further air vents. The central MMI touch display, which appears clean and light, occupies the space in front of it. It is tilted toward the driver and is positioned within ergonomically easy reach.</p><p>A lean inlay, known as the tech layer, lies above the display and connects it with the instrument panel. The choice of surface materials for this panel includes open-pore lime wood, aluminum in two different designs, and plastic. The inlay in the S line interior will also be available as an alternative shortly after market launch with an innovative, anthracite-colored technical fabric that is made partly of recycled materials.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/interior/interior3s.jpg alt=Interior></p><p>Depending on the equipment package, the further contours of the instrument panel, which are known as accent surfaces, are designed in various silver and gray tones to match the inlay. The most striking of these runs across horizontally, dividing the instrument panel into two zones, and is decorated with an e-tron badge. Below this contour, also facing the driver, lies the climate control operating unit. Below it, a large operating panel with a black-panel look extends into the space. It features the compact shifter for selecting the gears, a capacitive rotary volume control and the start/stop button. The hazard warning light switch as well as the Audi drive select buttons and the ESC stabilization control are designed as seamless touch surfaces in a black panel look and backlit with white backlighting.</p><p>The <a href=interior/steeringwheels/>steering wheels</a> in the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron are also setting a course for the future of mobility. With their double-spoke design, they belong to a new generation. The Four Rings on the impact absorber feature a flat design, in the S line interior an S emblem adorns the bottom spoke. The upper spokes feature touch surfaces in a black-panel look, where the functional areas are also backlit to indicate the active buttons.</p><p>Slight protrusions separate them from each other, making them easier to use, while the buttons provide feedback that is soft to the touch when pressed. Just as on a smartphone, there are not only touch gestures but also swipe gestures, for example for scrolling through lists.</p><p>The <a href=interior/steeringwheels/>steering wheels</a> are available in different versions. The top-of-the-range version features paddles affixed to the steering wheel for coasting recuperation and a two-part trim on the spokes. The heated rim is flattened at the top and bottom here – a solution that prominently underlines the futuristic character of the interior. Be it look, function, or feel – the new steering wheel clearly expresses the progressive character of the Q4 e-tron.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/interior/seats/seats_pwa_1s.jpg alt="Standard Seats">
The seats are available in a basic version and a sport version with visually integrated head restraints, and optionally with a rhombus pattern.</p><p><a href=interior/seats/#seat-functionality>Seat heating</a>, <a href=interior/seats/#seat-functionality>electric adjustment</a>, and <a href=interior/seats/#seat-functionality>electric lumbar support are available</a> as an option.</p><p>When it comes to the seat colors, customers can choose between black, steel gray, Santos brown, and pergament beige. The total of nine equipment packages also includes a stitching package. Five packages are available for the basic version, while the other four are available for the S line interior. They have different door sill trims, paint colors for the accent surfaces, materials for the armrests, and headlining. All optional equipment packages for the interior include white LED lighting, or, alternatively, the <a href=interior/lights/#ambient-light-plus-package>multi-color ambient lighting package plus</a>. Some features are reserved exclusively for the S line interior: illuminated aluminum door sill trims with S logo, pedals with stainless steel supports, a black headlining, S embossing in the seat backrests, a steering wheel rim made of perforated leather with contrasting stitching, and S badges.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/interior/seats/seats_pwn_2s.jpg alt=S-line></p><p>The <a href=interior/sline/>S line interior</a> also has a great deal to offer in terms of upholstery materials. Customers who prefer traditional materials can choose between a leather/artificial leather mixture and the premium fine Nappa leather. The combination of artificial leather and the microfiber material Dinamica offers an innovative variant. The Puls upholstery, also in combination with artificial leather, is another option for the S line interior. As with Dinamica, secondary raw materials, for example made from old PET bottles, are also used here.</p><p>See all details in the <a href=interior>Audi Q4 e-tron interior section</a></p><h2 id=audi-q4-e-tron-drivetrain>Audi Q4 e-tron drivetrain</h2><p>Audi Q4 e-tron is based on the MEB platform that is shared with other models like Skoda Enyaq, Volkswagen ID4, and ID3.</p><h3 id=battery>Battery</h3><p>It is delivered with 2 battery sizes</p><ul><li>55 kWh gross / 51.5 kWh net on Audi Q4 e-tron 35</li><li>82 kWh gross / 76.6 kWh net on Audi Q4 e-tron 40,45 and 50</li></ul><p>The range with the biggest battery is between 412 km - 521 km depending on version and equipment trim.</p><h3 id=motors>Motors</h3><p>The Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron include a wide range of drives – from the city cruiser to the powerful quattro. They are being launched on the European markets with two different battery sizes and three motor line-ups. In the Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron a
permanently excited synchronous machine (PSM) on the rear wheels provides the drive – these two models, along with the R8 V10 RWD high-performance sports car, are the only seriesproduction Audi models with purely rear-wheel drive. The Q4 45 e-tron quattro and Q4 50 e-tron quattro as the sporty top model uses two electric motors for its electric all-wheel drive.</p><p>See all details in the <a href=drivetrain>Audi Q4 e-tron drivetrain section</a></p><h3 id=suspension>Suspension</h3><p>The Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron integrate the best conditions for high levels of comfort, driving pleasure, and unshakable stability. In the models with up to 150 kW (204 PS) of power, the rear-wheel drive ensures excellent traction – which the customer can experience in many situations, starting with driving on wet roads. The high-voltage battery is located beneath the passenger compartment, at the lowest point of the car. This is a great advantage for the center of gravity and the distribution of the axle loads: In all drive variants, this distribution is close to the ideal value of 50:50.</p><p>The front axle of the compact electric SUVs is designed in the classic McPherson construction method, the steering is located underneath at the front. A compact five-link design featuring similarities with the rear axle of the large Audi models works at the rear. As with the front axle, it is mounted on a subframe. Several parts of the suspension are made of lightweight aluminum.</p><p>You can get optional sport suspension (standard in S line), progressive steering (standard in quattro models), Audi drive select (standard in the Sportback), and suspension with damper control(option available for all models).</p><h2 id=audi-q4-e-tron-technology>Audi Q4 e-tron technology</h2><p>Audi Q4 e-tron has a lot of advanced technology.</p><h3 id=driver-assistance>Driver assistance</h3><p>One front radar, one front camera, four surround-view cameras, two rear radars and eight ultrasonic sensors: When fully equipped, the sensor system of the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron covers a large sensing field and a large number of traffic situations.
Important driver assist systems come as standard, the optional systems are subdivided into four packages: the assist package, the assist package plus, the assist package pro, and the safety package.</p><p>One of the systems equipped as standard is the lane departure warning – its steering interventions can prevent the car from inadvertently straying out of the lane. Using the radar and the camera, Audi pre sense front safety system can identify impending collisions in front of
the car, warn the driver, and initiate braking in an emergency. The turn assist system supports the driver in the same way when turning left, the collision avoidance assist helps them steer around obstacles by providing steering movements. The acoustic and optical parking system
measures the distance to the rear.</p><p>The predictive efficiency assist, which evaluates navigation data and traffic signs, helps the driver save energy. When the car is approaching a zone that demands a slow speed – a built-up area, an intersection, or a curve for example – it indicates to the driver that they should take
their foot off the right-hand pedal. When they do that, the system manages the coasting and recuperation without the driver having to take any action. Fatigue assist uses defined patterns to continuously check whether the driver is in good shape. The traffic sign recognition system and
the predictive speed limiter round off the range of the standard systems.</p><h3 id=lights>Lights</h3><p>The headlights of the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron are fully equipped with LEDs as standard. On request, Audi also offers the <a href=technology/lights/#matrix-headlights>Matrix LED headlights</a> – they lend the two electric compact SUVs a look that is full of character and unmistakable, day and night.</p><p>The next stage of evolution in daytime running lights is totally new among the competition. Using the MMI touch operating system, the driver can switch between four digital light signatures at any time. Each of them generates its own theme and lends the daytime running lights an individual expression. The variant selected is activated the next time the vehicle is started.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/technology/lights/signature1s.jpg alt=Matrix></p><p>The Matrix LED headlights are divided into two sections in terms of optics and technology. The completely black lower half conceals the units for the low beam and the Matrix LED high beam. The 16 individual LEDs that comprise it are regulated so that they always illuminate the road as brightly as possible without blinding other road users.</p><p>The upper half forms a bright eye. A flat segment runs across the headlights here, serving a dual function in generating a fixed daytime running light and the dynamic turn signals. Above and below it are a total of nine flat daytime running light segments, which, together with the large vertical anchor segment at the outer edge, can be configured into four digital light signatures. Two slat trims made of brushed stainless steel divide the digital daytime running light segments into 49 small sections. Seen from the side, they appear to be well shielded, lying one on top of the other like the slats of vertical blinds; the full power of the individual light segments is easily visible from the front – creating a fascinating effect that plays with light and shadows.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/technology/lights/rearwithmatrix2s.jpg alt=Taillights></p><p>In combination with the Matrix LED headlights, there is also a particularly elegant light solution at the rear of the compact electric SUV. A light strip runs across its full width; at its center the taillight beams out in a fine line that splits into separate segments at its ends. Each individual
segment is modeled as a three-dimensional body, resulting in a light sculpture that is expressive from all perspectives. The light signature opens up into a large light anchor segment on the sides of the vehicle. Its dynamic graphic is inspired by intricate electric circuits and bears the
Four Rings radiating in signature red as the central detail. The dynamic turn signals add a further highlight in the reversing lights.</p><p>When the car is unlocked and exited, dynamic “leaving home” and “coming home” light sequences are played in the rear lights and the headlights. The sequences in the headlights vary depending on which daytime running light signature is selected.</p><h3 id=interface-and-operations>Interface and operations</h3><p>Just as in all of its models, Audi relies on a fully digital operating and display concept with a flat menu structure in the Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. It comprises four levels: the digital instrument cluster or Audi virtual cockpit for the driver, the central MMI touch display, the natural-language voice control, and the optional augmented reality head-up display – it is a new, pioneering piece of technology.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/virtualcockpit/mminavigationvirtualcockpits.jpg alt="Virtual cockpit"></p><p>The standard digital instrument cluster measures 10.25 inches on the diagonal and is operated from the multifunction steering wheel. The power meter, which is located next to the speedometer on the display, summarizes all important information about the drive, from the output and the state of charge of the battery in percent and all the way to recuperation. The Audi virtual cockpit is the first option level. It integrates the navigation map and infotainment control and can be switched between two views. The Audi virtual cockpit is the top-of-the-line version. It offers the “classic,” “sport,” and “e-tron” layouts, where the power meter plays the main part. Various displays can be configured freely here.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/mmi/mmi2s.jpg alt=MMI></p><p>The MMI touch display with acoustic feedback has a 10.1-inch diagonal and a resolution of 1,540 x 720 pixels. It is used to control the infotainment system as well as a number of comfort functions. In addition, it allows text input in handwriting. In the optional large version, the display comes with an 11.6-inch diagonal and a resolution of 1,764 x 824 pixels. It is the largest display in the Audi portfolio to date and is expected to be available for order this year.</p><p>The natural-language voice control, which is activated with the key phrase “Hey Audi,” functions as the third control level in the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Q4 Sportback e-tron. It also understands a large number of inputs and queries in everyday language, such as “Where’s the nearest Italian restaurant?” If Audi connect Navigation & Infotainment plus is included, in many cases the information is processed online.</p><p><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/models/q4-e-tron/technology/uiandoperations/headupdisplay/headups.jpg alt=Headup></p><p>With the optional augmented reality head-up display in the Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron, Audi is taking a huge step forward in display technology. The display reflects important information via the windshield on two separate levels, the status section and the augmented
reality (AR) section. The information provided by some of the assist systems and the turning arrows of the navigation system as well as its starting points and destinations are visually superimposed in the corresponding place on the real-life outside world as content of the AR section and displayed dynamically. They appear to be floating at a distance of roughly ten meters from the driver. Depending on the situation, they can appear considerably further ahead in some cases. The driver can understand the displays very quickly without being confused or distracted by them, and they are extremely helpful in poor visibility conditions.</p><p>See all details in the <a href=technology>Audi Q4 e-tron technology section</a></p><h2 id=audi-q4-e-tron-transportation-capabilities>Audi Q4 e-tron Transportation capabilities</h2><p>In addition to the 5 seats the luggage compartment also offers more space than is generally found in the compact class, matching that of the mid-size class: Depending on the positioning of the rear seat backs, the volume of the luggage compartment is 520 to 1,490 liters in the Q4 e-tron and 535 to 1,460 liters under a power trunk lid in the Sportback.
