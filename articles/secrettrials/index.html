The air is crisply cold and the thermometer says -21 degrees (-5.8 Fahrenheit) on this January morning. The hum of snowplows is audible outside the hotel as they push the fresh snow from the frozen lake and prepare the test tracks just a few hundred meters away. Raphael Kis has pulled his black woolen cap low over his face and is trudging through the Swedish gloom toward the workshop. The paths are short: “You could say you fall out of the hotel directly into the workshop,” Kis says. It is 7:00 – time to start work for this family man who, as an Audi calibration engineer, is responsible for tuning driving characteristics like stability and traction.</p><h2 id=closed-off-from-the-outside-world>Closed off from the outside world</h2><p>The workshop is on the Volkswagen Group’s extensive testing grounds in Sweden – simply called “KALT 1” for reasons of secrecy. Fences completely seal off the area in Lapland and everything is strictly confidential. This is where Audi calibrates its future models on ice and snow. The testing mecca covers more than 3,600 hectares (8,896 acres) in total – about 1.7 times the surface area of the Frankfurt airport. Apart from several workshops with office workplaces and a hotel with 440 beds, the grounds offer wintery stretches totaling 83 kilometers (51.6 miles) in length.</p><p>The next-largest town is several kilometers away and even the nearest supermarket is beyond walking distance. Nonetheless, the roughly 150 employees on average, who are there only for Audi, are well supplied. The all-inclusive carefree package includes three mealtimes in the hotel restaurant, two exercise rooms, and a hotel bar. “We’re together with a lot of people – you have to like that. If you’re not up for that, you won’t be able to stand it for long.” Raphael Kis has been at it for 14 years, about 20 weeks per year, of which about ten weeks are in Sweden.</p><figure><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/articles/secrettrials/secrettrials3.jpg><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/articles/secrettrials/secrettrials3s.jpg class=img-fluid alt="2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype" title="2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype"></a><figcaption><h4>2023 Audi SQ8 e-tron prototype</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id=fine-tuning-in-the-swedish-winter>Fine tuning in the Swedish winter</h2><p>This morning, Kis is sitting in a workshop office and gearing up for fine tuning a new Audi model. The next generation <a href=../../models/e-tron/>Audi e-tron</a>. Expected to be re-named <a href=../../models/q8-e-tron/>Audi Q8 e-tron</a>. When his son was younger, he explained his job to him this way: “Daddy sits in a car and adjusts it so that people can drive safely.” Admittedly, it is not quite so simple – and Kis dispels one preconception right away: “I don’t drive in circles all day long, as one might imagine,” he says and grins. Here and there, new software has to be run on the car and occasionally experts also have to adjust the hardware. Calibrating a vehicle takes over a year, usually one and a half winters: Kis and his colleagues ideally establish a baseline on dry road in order to adjust the basic handling. Test drives follow on a wet road surface before the Swedish winter sets in starting in late November. Ultimately, the car should drive harmoniously on dry and wet roads as well as on ice and snow. “The ABS, ASC, and driving dynamics control have to correspond to Audi DNA,” Kis explains. The automotive group thinks of its DNA as fulfilling certain criteria that characterize an Audi’s unmistakable handling.</p><p>Calibration in dry Spain is on the agenda for February in order to “drive against it” again in Sweden, as Kis says. “It’s a constant interplay.” The new Audi model’s handling is also refined over the course of a year on mountain roads and passes. “The different road profiles should always be as customer-oriented as possible.” The suspension experts plan on doing the final fine tuning the following winter.</p><h2 id=adjustments-on-a-laptop>Adjustments on a laptop</h2><p>Thick snowflakes are still fluttering from the sky outside the window, illuminated by the light of the workshop. “December and January are the dark months in Sweden – that’s pretty tough,” the developer says. This particular day, the sun came up at 9 AM and went down again at 2 PM. Kis says that February and March are the beautiful months in the northern kingdom. That is when the sun and the blue sky occasionally transform the testing grounds into a magical winter landscape. “But you also get used to the darkness. All the roads are well lit by roof-mounted headlights,” Kis says as he wedges his laptop under his arm and grabs the car keys from the desk.</p><p>Moments later, the laptop is firmly in its bracket on the passenger seat of a car stickered with camouflage film. Various parameters can be changed on the computer in order to get incrementally closer to the target characteristics. The Audi should be easy to control – including in the threshold range. All control systems have to respond reliably to the driving conditions that are present. Superior traction is also considered a typical Audi characteristic. Despite electric cars, tuning has not fundamentally changed over the years.</p><figure><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/articles/secrettrials/secrettrials2.jpg><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/articles/secrettrials/secrettrials2s.jpg class=img-fluid alt="Adjusting behaviour" title="Adjusting behaviour"></a><figcaption><h4>Adjusting behaviour</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id=routinized-driving-on-thick-ice>Routinized driving on thick ice</h2><p>Kis’ next station on the testing grounds is a stretch on the frozen lake – about three kilometers long and with the same curves each year thanks to saved GPS data. Mounds of snow that were cleared off the route early in the morning are now piled up alongside it. Conifers on the banks groan under the weight of the snow and leave their branches hanging. How will the Audi respond to the icy roadway? Kis presses on the gas pedal and the car heads for the first curve to the left.</p><p>The Audi drifts through the curve and swirls the snow particles a good two meters up into the icy air. “These are the moments when the job is really fun,” says Kis. The handling specialist routinely steers the car through the course a few times until he has gathered enough information.</p><p>He does not need to fear that the sheet of ice will not support the car. At the start of the season, the team checks the ice with a snowmobile and measures its thickness. It needs to be at least 25 to 30 centimeters (9.8-11.8 inches) for a car to be able to drive on it. If the ice is too thin, hovercraft push the snow off the surface over and over. Given that snow has an isolating effect, the ice would grow more slowly otherwise. The result is a layer of ice that is up to 90 centimeters (35.4 inches) thick.</p><h2 id=analyzing-the-measurement-results>Analyzing the measurement results</h2><p>Back in the workshop. Analyzing the measurement results with functional developers and system partners is on the agenda after lunch in the hotel restaurant. A certain personal touch is discernible in the calibration, but Kis discusses a model’s target characteristics in advance with the development team leader and other colleagues. The nuances in their opinions vary widely from one to another. “What happens is that someone thinks that the car should oversteer a little bit more, for example,” says Kis. “But all in all, we have pretty much the same understanding of how the car should drive in the end.”</p><p>Darkness has long fallen once more over the testing grounds when Kis takes his jacket from the back of the chair and slips on his cap. Quitting time after a ten-hour workday. “Dinner, chatting with my co-workers, and a video call home. Back at it tomorrow!” Kis says and disappears into the green light of the hotel lobby.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDzsA8CKdFY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><ul class="children children-li js-moveChildrenFrom"></ul></div><div class="col-xl-4 col-xxl-4 p-4 d-none d-lg-block"><div class="container p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded border"><h3>Audi all-electric models</h3><p>Click on link for direct access to the different model info for Audi all-electric models</p><ul class="list-group list-group-numbered"><ol class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q4-e-tron/>Audi Q4 e-tron</a></ol><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q6-e-tron/>Audi Q6 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q8-e-tron/>Audi Q8 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/a4-e-tron/>Audi A4 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/a6-e-tron/>Audi A6 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/e-tron/>Audi e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/e-tron-gt/>Audi e-tron GT</a></li></ul></div></div></div></main><footer class="container bg-dark"><ul class="nav justify-content-center"><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.facebook.com/electrichasgoneaudi><i class="bi-facebook text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIX5hOCjiv5eTeiJsB7hwkg><i class="bi-youtube text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.instagram.com/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-instagram text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-linkedin text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://github.com/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-github text-white"></i></a></li></ul><a class=navbar-brand href=/><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src=/images/logo400b.png class=img-fluid alt="EVKX logo"></a></footer></div><script src=/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
