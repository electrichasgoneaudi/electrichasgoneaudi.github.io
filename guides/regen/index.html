requires 39,89 kW (24,94 kWh/100km) to overcome drag.</p><p>Temperature affects density.

If we assume 80% efficiency in the drivetrain, we have an energy need of 15.2kWh/100km in total including drag.</p><p>If we take away the energy needed for drag, we have around 8.95kWh/100km to overcome rolling resistance.</p><p>This number is an estimate.

For scenario 1, driving down Pikes Peak is impossible without regenerative braking. If
you don&rsquo;t use regen you will crash. But if you assume flat road on scenarios 2 and 3, you would do better if you look ahead and let the car coast, so it uses the
rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag to reduce the speed.</p><p>This would mean you need to lift your foot from the watt pedal early enough so you stop at the point you want by itself.</p><p>So how much energy would that save? Two factors reduce total consumption.</p><ul><li>You will not lose 20% of the kinetic energy when regening</li><li>You will not lose 20% of the energy trying to keep the speed</li></ul><p>Theoretical this can save</p><ul><li>Scenario 2: 1.89 kWh/100km</li><li>Scenario 3: 3.02 kWh/100km</li></ul><p>But this is in the best-case scenario where you can calculate exactly where to lift the foot of the watt pedal. In the real world, this benefit would be smaller since you would end up needing to add some power or braking at the end when you are not able to calculate this correctly.</p><h2 id=can-you-see-in-the-car-how-much-was-regenerated>Can you see in the car how much was regenerated?</h2><p>A common misunderstanding is that you can look at the range reported in the car to see how much was regenerated.</p><p>The range meter bases its calculation on the last 100km driven. If we take scenario 4 and assume the car has been driven from sea level up to the top at 650 meters in 80km/h (49.7 mph) the consumption would be 25.4kWh/100km at 650 meters.</p><p>On the Audi e-tron 55 with 86.5kWh battery capacity, the range would be calculated to 340km (211 miles) for a full battery based on this consumption.</p><p>After driving down the road section scenario 4 the total consumption from the battery would be reduced from 25.4kWh/100km to 21kWh/100km.</p><p>This would increase the calculated range to 411km (255 miles) for a charged 100% battery (less depending on the real SOC). Based on this you could mistakenly believe that you have regenerated 71km (44 miles), but the correct is 6.8km.(4.2 miles)</p><p>This type of increase you could even see in scenarios where there is no regeneration, but just a decline that reduced the consumption.</p><p>The only way to know how much you have regenerated is to look at how much the state of charge of the battery changes from top to bottom of the mountain.</p><figure><a href=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/guides/regen/soc.jpg><img src=https://media.electrichasgoneaudi.net/multimedia/guides/regen/soc.jpg class=img-fluid alt="State of charge, the only way to see how much you have regenerated" title="State of charge, the only way to see how much you have regenerated"></a><figcaption><h4>State of charge, the only way to see how much you have regenerated</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id=one-pedal-driving-vs-manualautomatic-regen>One pedal driving vs manual/automatic regen</h2><p>On electric Audis, you can use regenerative brakes in different ways</p><ul><li>Manual, only using the brake pedal</li><li>Automatic, letting the car decide when to regenerate</li><li>Manual, using steering wheel paddles to regenerate</li><li>One pedal driving - automatic regenerate when lifting the foot off watt pedal</li></ul><p>All methods use the same electric drivetrain components to do braking, so they have the same efficiency.</p><p>But one-pedal-driving has a little reduced efficiency in scenarios where the driver wants to transition from using power to coasting.</p><p>Since you would need to keep your foot on the pedal at a specific position to not use any energy or braking you will always spend more time coming to this position compared to lifting the foot directly off the pedal. In addition, it takes some training to keep the foot in perfect position.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why Audi recommends using automatic regen with coasting to save energy.</p><p>The difference is small, probably less than 10% of the difference between coasting and regenerative braking in the scenarios where coasting is possible.</p><p>For scenarios like scenario 1, there is no difference since you will do regenerative braking to keep the car on the road.</p><p>Since the difference is so small, you should choose based on your personal preference.</p><p>You can read more about <a href=../onepedaldriving/>one-pedal-driving</a></p></div><div class="col-xl-4 col-xxl-4 p-4 d-none d-lg-block"><div class="container p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded border"><h3>Audi all-electric models</h3><p>Click on link for direct access to the different model info for Audi all-electric models</p><ul class="list-group list-group-numbered"><ol class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q4-e-tron/>Audi Q4 e-tron</a></ol><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q6-e-tron/>Audi Q6 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/q8-e-tron/>Audi Q8 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/a4-e-tron/>Audi A4 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/a6-e-tron/>Audi A6 e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/e-tron/>Audi e-tron</a></li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"><a class="text-decoration-none text-black" href=/models/e-tron-gt/>Audi e-tron GT</a></li></ul></div></div></div></main><footer class="container bg-dark"><ul class="nav justify-content-center"><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.facebook.com/electrichasgoneaudi><i class="bi-facebook text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIX5hOCjiv5eTeiJsB7hwkg><i class="bi-youtube text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.instagram.com/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-instagram text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-linkedin text-white"></i></a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=https://github.com/electrichasgoneaudi/><i class="bi-github text-white"></i></a></li></ul><a class=navbar-brand href=/><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src=/images/logo400b.png class=img-fluid alt="EVKX logo"></a></footer></div><script src=/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
